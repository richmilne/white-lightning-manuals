For example, suppose you wanted to scroll a window, four characters square, in the
middle of the screen and invert it after each sideways scroll.  First we need to
define a word to do the scrolling and the inverting.  For some reason, most test
programs are called FRED and there is no reason for breaking with convention.  To
define the word type:

: FRED WRR1V INVV ; <CR>

To set up the parameters type:

4 HGT' ! 4 LEN' ! 14 COL' ! 9 ROW' ! <CR>

To make sure there is some data in the window, type:

VLIST <CR>

You are now ready to execute the background program by typing:

' FRED INT-ON <CR>

To halt this program type:

INT-OFF <CR>

This program is running a bit too fast to see, so let's write another program
which slows this down to every fifth interrupt, i.e. ten times a second.  We will
need to define a variable and a new word.  To set up the variable type:

0 VARIABLE ICNT <CR>

This sets up a variable called ICNT and assigns to it the value 0.  We'll call
this new background word FREDA.  Type:

: FREDA ICNT @ 1+ 5 > IF FRED 0 ICNT ! ELSE 1 ICNT + ! ENDIF ; <CR>

Now type:

' FREDA INT-ON <CR>

All "FREDA" does, is to increment ICNT and compare it with 5 and if it is greater
than 5 then "FREDA" is executed and ICNT set back to zero.

It would be useful to be able to control the speed that "FREDA" ran at, so, let's
modify "FREDA" to do this.  First, type INT-OFF FORGET FREDA <CR> to get rid of
the old definition and then set up a new variable and construct a slightly
different program.  A variable wbich sets the limit on the number of interrupts
needs to he set up, so type: 4 VARIABLE LCNT <CR>.  The new definition is set up
by typing:

: FREDA ICNT @ 1+ LCNT @ > IF FRED 0 ICNT ! ELSE 1 ICNT +! FNDIF ; <CR>

To execute the new word type:

0 ICNT ! ' FREDA INT-0N <CR>

This program increments ICNT, compares it with LCNT and executes when ICNT is
equal to LCNT.  Increasing LCNT then, will slow the background execution and
decrementing LCNT will speed it up.  If LCNT is put equal to 1, execution will
occur every cycle.
