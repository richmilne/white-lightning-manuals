**8. CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES**

White Lightning also allows you to define your own constants and variables using
the Fourth words:

CONSTANT
VARIABLE

When a constant is called up, this causes its VALUE to be pushed onto the stack,
however, when a variable is called up, this causes its address to be pushed onto
the stack.  The Forth words ! and @ are used to modify the contents of the
variable.

A constant is defined by using the form:

value CONSTANT name

and any references to the name will cause the value n to be put on the stack.

A variable is defined using the form:

value VARIABLE name

and any reference to the name will result in the address of that variable to be
put on the stack for further manipulation using ! and @.  It is essential that you
realise the difference between the contents and the address of a variable.

Now for some examples:

  64 CONSTANT R 1000 CONSTANT Q
 256 VARIABLE X
   0 VARIABLE Y

R Q + .  will print the value of R + Q i.e. 1064
    X .  will print the address of X, not its value
  X @ .  will print the value of X, i.e. 256
  R Y !  will store the value of R in the variable Y
  Y X !  will store the address of Y in the variable X
  4 X !  will store the value 4 in variable X

**BASIC statement**       **Forth Equivalent**

LET X = Y             Y @ X !
LET X = R             R X !
LET X = 4             4 X !
LET X = X + 5         5 X +!


**OTHER COMMONLY USED FORTH WORDS**


**LIST**    : This will list the contents of the screen number held on the top of
          the stack.

e.g.  6 LIST will list screen 6 to the screen.  Note that if source has not been
typed into any of the screens, they will probably contain garbage.


**FORGET**  : This is used to delete part of the Lightning dictionary.  Please note
          that not only will the word following FORGET be erased, but so will
          every word defined after it!
