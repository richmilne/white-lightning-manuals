Group 3

This group, possibly the most useful in the whole set, comprises commands which
support operations between sprites and sprite windows.  The same set of commands
as those in Group 2 are available and the format for each word is the same as in
Group 2, except that the commands are postfixed with an "M" instead of an "S".
The chief difference to the user lies in the set of parameters.  The size of the
data window is set to have the dimensions of the first sprite, and its position in
the second sprite is set using the SCOL and SROW parameters.


Parameter                 Use

SP1        Number of the first sprite
SP2        Number of the second sprite (containing the window)
SCOL       Left hand column of target sprite window
SROW       Top row of target sprite window


Command                 Action

GWBLM      Block move pixel data from first sprite into window in second sprite
GWORM      OR pixel data from first sprite into window in second sprite
GWXRM      XOR pixel data from first sprite into window in second sprite
GWNDM      AND pixel data from first sprite into window in second sprite
GWATTM     Block move attribute data from first sprite into window in second
           sprite
PWBLM      Block move pixel data from window in second sprite into first sprite
PWORM      OR pixel data from window in second sprite into first sprite
PWXRM      XOR pixel data from window in second sprite into first sprite
PWNDM      AND pixel data from window in second sprite into first sprite
PWATTM     Block move attribute data from window in second sprite into first
           sprite

Note:

If the width of the first sprite added to SCOL, or the height of the first sprite
added to SROW exceeds either the width or height of the second sprite
respectively, then the command will not execute.


COPY COMMANDS

These five commands, are in fact a sub-group of the Group 3 commands and allow
operations between pairs of sprites with the same dimensions.  It is necessary,
therefore, to provide only two parameters instead of four.


parameter                 Use

SPl          Number of first sprite
SP2          Number of second sprite
