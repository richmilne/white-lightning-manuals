SR8

Moves landscapes 8 pixels (1 character) right and adjusts pointers provided a full
character boundary has been reached.  If not a further 4 pixel scroll is
executed.

SL8

As SR8 when movement is to the left.

UR

If speed is greater than 200, try and scroll right 8 pixels right, f not, try and
scroll by 4 pixels right.

LR

If speed is greater than 7 then scroll 1 pixel right else no scroll.

RT

If speed is greater than 100 then do a UR if not do an LR.

UL

As UR when speed is negative.

LL

As LR when speed is negative.

LF

As RF when speed is negative.

DEC

The execution word which does all the scrolling logic.  The words UR to LF are
effectively the nodes of a tree which produce one of 7 possible scrolls from -8
pixels to +8 pixels.  A detailed understanding of the workings are not necessary
as long as you can adapt the routine to serve your needs.

SET

Creates 7 new orientations of the lander from the original in sprite 100, making 8
in all, each lander being 1 pixel shifted vertically from the one before.  This
enables single pixel resolution in the lander movement.

PREP

Used to set up initial values.

TICK

Increments vertical velocity (acts like gravity) unless terminal velocity has been
reached.  If you want to make the game more difficult change 1 VEL +! to 2 VEL +!
and thus double the planets gravity.
