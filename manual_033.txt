VLIST    : This is Just typed in :as a s_nyle word with no parameters. IC will cause a list of all the words defir-3 so far; pressing WEAK (CAPS SHIFT li SPACE as in BASIC) will stop the listing.


LOAD    : This will compile the source code that you have created using the editor into the White Lightning dictionary, to bemra ~w Lightning words. Loading will terminate at the end of a screen r at the Forth ward ;S unless the "conti.nue loading" ward -> is used at the end of a screen. The idea of the screen will became obvious in the next section on editing.


USING THE EDITOR

Generally speaking, most users will want to use the Spectrum editor to
type and edit source, but a full Forth line editor is included for
compatibility with existing texts. The maximum length of any line is 64
characters; any characters after this will be ignored.

Line Editor

Included in this version of White Lightning is a line editor to enable you
to create source or text files. To facilitate text editing, the text is
organised into blocks of 512 bytes, divided into 8 lines of 64 characters.
Once the text has been edited, it may then be compiled into the White
Lightning dictionary and the text, if required, can be saved to tape. The
text is stored in memory in the pages at C000 to F000; therefore, you can
edit into screens 1 to 23. If the background facility is utilised, text is
stored from CC00 onwards in screens 6 to 23, and screens 0 to 5 cannot be
used.

Here is a list of the editor commands and their descriptions:


H    Hold the text pointed to by the top number on the stack of
    the current screen in a temporary area known as PAD.

e.g. 4 H will hold line 4 of the current screen in PAD.


S    Fill (Spread) the line number at the top of the stack with blanks,
    and shift down all subsequent lines by 1, with the last line
    being lost.

e.g. 6 S will fill line 6 with blanks and move all other lines down by one, pushing the last line off the screen.    i

D    Delete the line number held on the stack; all other lines are
    moved up by 1. The line is held in PAD in case it is still needed.
    Line 7 cannot be deleted.
E    Erase the line number at the top of the stack by filling it with
    spaces.
RE    REplaced the line number at the top of the stack with the line
    currently held in PAD.
