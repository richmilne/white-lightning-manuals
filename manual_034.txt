P      :  Put the following text on the line number held on the stack, by
          overwriting its present contents.


INS    :  INSert the text from PAD to the line number held on the stack.
          The original and subsequent lines are moved down by 1 with the last
          line being lost.


EDIT   :  Works just like the normal Sinclair line editor.  Also, it does an
          automatic list and an automatic flush.  This is far and away the best
          way to edit and the above are included only for compatibility
          with existing Forths.

CLEAR  :  Clear the screen number held on the stack and make it the current
          screen.


WHERE  :  If an error occurs during the loading of White Lightning's text
          screens, then keying in WHERE will result in the screen number and
          the offending line being displayed.  You can now use the other editing
          commands to edit the screen, or you may move to another screen by
          either LISTing or CLEARing it.

e.g.  15 LIST will now make screen 15 the current screen and will list the
contents.

In order to compile this screen into the dictionary, it is necessary to use the
word LOAD.


LOAD

This will start loading at the screen number held on the top of the stack and will
stop at the end of the screen.

If you wish to continue and LOAD the next screen, the current screen must end with
-->

This means "continue loading and interpreting".

If you wish to stop the LOADing anywhere in a screen then use: ;S

This means "stop loading and interpreting".

At the end of every editing session, and before saving your text, it is necessary
to FLUSH the memory buffers into the text area.  To do this, just key in:

FLUSH <CR>

Note that the EDIT command does an automatic FLUSH.

You can save your text to tape using the Spectrum 'SAVE' command.  You must first
enter BASIC by typing PROG  <CR> .

Now for an example of how to edit a text file:

The first step is to either LIST or CLEAR the screen about to be worked on:
