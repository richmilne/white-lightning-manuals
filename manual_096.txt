Leave a true flag if the number is less than zero (negative), otherwise leave a false flag.

Leave a true flag is the number is equal to zero, otherwise leave a false flag.

The run-time proceedure to conditionally branch.  If f is false (zero), the following in-line parameter is added to the interpretive pointer to branch ahead or back.  Compiled by IF, UNTIL, and WHILE.

Increment n1 by l.

Leave n1 incremented by 2.

Used in the form called a colon-definition:
           : cccc     ...      ;
Creates a dictionary entry defining cccc as equivalent to the following sequence of Forth word definitions '...' until the next ';' or ';CODE'.  The compiling process is done by the text interpreter as long as STATE is non-zero.  Other details are that the CONTEXT vocabulary is set to the CURRENT vocabulary and that words with the precedence bit set (P) are executed rather than being compiled.

Terminate a colon-definition and stop further compilation.  Compiles the run-time ;S.
