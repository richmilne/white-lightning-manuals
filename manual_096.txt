0<                   n --- f                              L0

Leave a true flag if the number is less than zero (negative), otherwise leave a
false flag.


0=                   n --- f                              L0

Leave a true flag is the number is equal to zero, otherwise leave a false flag.


0BRANCH              f ---                                C2

The run-time procedure to conditionally branch.  If f is false (zero), the
following in-line parameter is added to the interpretive pointer to branch ahead
or back.  Compiled by IF, UNTIL, and WHILE.


1+                  n1 --- n2                             L1

Increment n1 by l.


2+                  n1 --- n2                             L1

Leave n1 incremented by 2.


2@                addr --- nlow nhigh

32 bit fetch, nhigh is fetched from addr; nlow is fetched from addr-2.


2DUP             n2 n1 --- n2 n1 n2 n1

Duplicates the top two values on the stack.  Equivalent to OVER OVER.


:                                                     P,E,L0

Used in the form called a colon-definition:
               : cccc  ...  ;
Creates a dictionary entry defining cccc as equivalent to the following sequence
of Forth word definitions '...' until the next ';' or ';CODE'.  The compiling
process is done by the text interpreter as long as STATE is non-zero.  Other
details are that the CONTEXT vocabulary is set to the CURRENT vocabulary and that
words with the precedence bit set (P) are executed rather than being compiled.


;                                                     P,C,L0

Terminate a colon-definition and stop further compilation.  Compiles the run-time
;S.
