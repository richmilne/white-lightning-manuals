Command             Action

WCRM          Vertical scroll with wrap
SCRM          Vertical scroll, no wrap

Example:

To scroll sprite 5 downward by 11 pixels with wrap, use:

5 SPN ! -11 NPX ! WCRM


Attribute Scrolls

There are four commands to scroll attributes in any of the four directions:

Parameter               Use

SPN          Number of the sprite to be scrolled

Command               Action

ATTLM        Scroll attributes left  with wrap
ATTRM        Scroll attributes right with wrap
ATTUPM       Scroll attributes up    with wrap
ATTDNM       Scroll attributes down  with wrap


GETS AND PUTS

There are three groups of GETs and PUTs.  The first, and the fastest, carry out
operations between a full sprite and a previously defined window of the screen.
The second group carry out operations between sprite windows and screen windows.
The third, and probably most powerful group of commands in the sub-language, cover
operations between sprite windows and other sprites.

Suppose you have desiged a sprite 160 characters wide (5 screens) and you wish to
smoothly pixel scroll through this sprite via a screen window covering the bottom
five character rows of the screen.  A second dumny sprite, 1 character wider than
the screen can be used to GET from the larger sprite, scroll, PUT, scroll, Put and
so on for 1 character, then a second block, 1 character further into the larger
sprite can be GOT and so on.  Experimentation will soon show you how to do this.
These routines can be run in background to provide fast smooth scrolling
backdrops.


Group 1

This group provides block moves and logical operations between sprites and screen
windows - these are the fastest commands in the set.  This particular group does
not include seperate attribute commands but instead uses an attribute switch.  If
the switch is on, pixel data and attribute data are moved; if you do not require
to move attributes you can increase the speed of operations by switching off the
attribute switch.
