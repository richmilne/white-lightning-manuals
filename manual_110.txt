MESSAGE              n ---

Print on the selected output device the text of line n relative to screen 4 of
drive 0.  n may be positive or negative.  MESSAGE may be used to print incidental
text such as report headers.  If WARNING is zero, the message will simply be
printed as a number (disc unavailable).


MIN              n1 n2 --- min                            L0

Leave the smaller of two numbers.


MINUS               n1 --- n2                             L0

Leave the two's complement of a number.


MOD              n1 n2 --- mod                            L0

Leave the remainder of n1/n2, with the same sign as n1.


NEXT

This is the inner interpreter that uses the interpretive IP to execute compiled
Forth definitions.  It is not directly executed but is the return point for all
code procedures.  It acts by fetching the address pointed by IP, and storing this
value in register W.  It then jumps to the address pointed to by the address
pointed to by W.  W points to the code field of a definition which contains the
address of the code which executes for that definition.  This usage of indirect
threaded code is a major contributor to the power, portability, and extensibility
of Forth.


NFA                pfa --- nfa

Convert the parameter field address of a definition to its name field. See PFA.


NUMBER            addr --- d

Convert a character string left at addr with a preceeding count, to a signed
double number, using the current numeric base.  If a decimal point is encountered
in the text, its position will be given in DPL, but no other effect occurs.  If
numeric conversion is not possible, an error message will be given.


OFFSET                 --- addr                            U

A user variable which may contain a block offset to disc drives.  The contents of
OFFSET is added to the stack number by BLOCK.  Messages by MESSAGE are independent
of OFFSET.  See BLOCK, DR0, DR1, MESSAGE.


OR               n1 n2 --- or                             L0

Leave the bit-wise logical "OR" of two l6 bit values.
