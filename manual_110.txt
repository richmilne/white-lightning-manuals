MESSAGE              n ---                                                         

Print on the selected output device the text of line n relative to screen 4 of drive O.  n may be positive or negative.  MESSAGE may be used to print incidental text such as report headers.  If WARNING is zero, the message will simply be printed as a number (disc unavailable). 


MIN              n1 n2 --- min                                                   L0

Leave the smaller of two numbers. 


MINUS               n1 --- n2                                                    L0

Leave the two's complement of a number. 


MOD              n1 n2 --- mod                                                   L0

Leave the remainder of n1/n2, with the same sign as n1. 


MON                                                                                

Exit to the system monitor, leaving a re-entry to Forth, if possible. 


MOVE     addr1 addr2 n ---                                                         

Move the contents of n memory cells (l6 bit contents) beginning at addr1 into n ills beginning at addr2.  The contents of addr1 is moved first.  This definition is appropriate on on word addressing computers. 


NEXT                                                                               

This is the inner interpreter that uses the interpretive pointer IP to execute compiled Forth definitions.  It is not directly executed but is ff the return point for all code procedures.  It acts by fetching the address pointed by IP, storing this value in register W.  It then jumps to the address pointed to by the address pointed to by W.  W points to the code field of a definition which contains the address of the code which executes for that definition.  This usage of indirect threaded code is a major contributor to the power, portability, and extensibility of Forth.  Locations of IP and W are computer specific. 


NFA                pfa --- nfa                                                     

Convert the parameter.  field address of a definition to its name field. 


NUMBER            addr --- d                                                       

Convert a character string left at addr with a preceeding count, to a signed .double number, using the current numeric base.  If a decimal point is encountered in the text, its position will be given in DPL, but no other effect occurs.  If numeric conversion is not possible, an error message will be given. 


OFFSET                 --- addr                                                   U

A user variable which may contain a block offset to disc drives.  The contents of OFFSET is added to the stack number by BLOCK.  Messages by MESSAGE are independent of OFFSET.  See BLOCK, DR0, DR1, MESSAGE. 


OR               n1 n2 --- or                                                    L0

Leave the bit-wise logical or of two l6 bit values.
