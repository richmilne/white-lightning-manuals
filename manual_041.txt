SPST         Used to hold the start address of sprite space.

SPND         Used to hold the end of sprite space, i.e. the first free byte
             after the last sprite.  This is the address of the
             foreground scrollinq buffer.

SLEN         Used to hold the length of sprite space to be cleared
             by the COLD# command.

MLEN         Used to hold the size and direction of the relocation.
             A positive value relocates sprites to higher memory and
             a negative value to lower memory.

SPTR         On return from the TEST command, SPTR points to the start
             of the sprite.

DPTR         On return from the TEST crnnand, DPTR points to the start
             of the pixel data.


Alternate Variables

Eleven of the previously listed variables are replecated for use by the background
program (see Foreground/Background).  These are ROW', COL', LEN', HGT', NPX', SPN', SP1', SP2', SROW', SCOL' and SPND'.

When a word
is executed in background, the eleven alternate variables are
automatically switched with the eleven background variables; when
execution is complete, the variables are switched again to restore them to
their former state.

Suppose, for example, that the background program is to scroll left 1
pixel with wrap (WRL1V), with an area of screen 6 characters wide and 4
characters high, with top left co-ordinates row = 5, column = 7. Now type
the following:
CLS 6 LEN' ! 4 HGT' ! 5 ROW' ! 7 COL' ! ' WRL1V INT-ON [CR]
The window is now scrolling but you can't see it, because there is no data
in the window.

Type VLIST [CR] and watch the data as it scrolls through the window. The
data in the window will be slanting to the left, because the foreground
program was scrolling up at the same time as the background program
scrolled left.

Leaving the background program running, type:
10 LEN' ! [CR]
and the window will widen.

Type:
INT-OFF ' WRR8V INT-ON [CR]
and the screen will scroll to the right, this time much more rapidly. Now
type:
INT-OFF [CR]
to halt the background program.
