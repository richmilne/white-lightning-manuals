Now type:

CLS ." LOGICAL AND " CR ." LOGICAL AND " PUTNDS <CR>

This time, the only data remaining is at those points where the data coincided.
Logical "AND"s are normally used to mark off sections of the screen or sprites.
They are also used extensively for collision detection.  If a window of the screen
is "AND"ed into a sprite, and then a SCANM performed, it is possible to determine
whether a collision would occur if the sprite were PUT; before actually PUTting
the sprite.

We now come to the logical XOR.  This is probably the most useful operation of the
lot. "XOR"s have the peculiar property of restoring the destination data to its
former state if the operation is performed twice.  This is how Sinclair's own
"OVER" operation works.  To see this happen type:

CLS ." XOR " CR ." XOR " PUTXRS <CR>

To restore the text type:

PUTXRS <CR>

We can even use this property to swap two sprites without using a third.  This
example will swap the data but not the attributes.  We will "PUT" two sprites at
each stage so you can see what is happening.  Type:

CLS ATTON 0 SCOL ! 0 SROW ! 1 SP1 ! 2 SP2 ! 23 COL ! 6 0 AT <CR>

Now type:

1 SPN ! PUTBLS 2 SPN ! 27 COL ! PUTBLS <CR>

These are the tao sprites before the operations begin.

Now type:

GWXRM 2 ROW ! 23 COL ! 1 SPN ! PUTBLS 27 COL ! 2 SPN ! PUTBLS <CR>

sprite 1 has now been "XOR"ed into sprite 2.  Now type:

PWXRM 4 ROW ! 23 COL ! 1 SPN ! PUTBLS 27 COL 1 2 SPN ! PUTBLS <CR>

sprite 2 is now in sprite 1.  Finally, type:

GWXRM 6 ROW ! 23 COL ! 1 SPN ! PUTBLS 27 COL ! 2 SPN ! PUTBLS <CR>

The operation is now commplete.

If we wanted to add a new word to the language which swaps two equally sized
sprites whose numbers were in SP1 and SP2, we would now do so.

: SWOP 0 SCOL ! 0 SROW 1 GWXRM PWXRM GWXRM ; <CR>

In fact we could also use:

: SWOP 0 SCOL ! 0 SROW ! PWXRM GXXRM PWXRM ; <CR>

for exactly the same effect.  You will get MSG # 4 if you type the second word
before typing FORGOT SWOP <CR>

Ironically, even though we can swap pixel data, there is no simple method for
swapping attribute data unless a third sprite is involved.
