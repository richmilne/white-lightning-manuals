Execute the definition whose code field address is on the stack.  The code field 
address is also called the compilation address. 


EXPECT      addr count ---                                L0

Transfer characters from the terminal to address, until a return or the count of 
characters has been received.  One or more nulls are added at the end of the 
text. 


FENCE                  --- addr                            U

A user variable containing an address below which FORGETting is trapped.  To 
forget below this point the user must alter the contents of FENCE. 


FILL       addr quan b ---                                                         

Fill memory at the address with the specified quantity of bytes b. 


FIRST                  --- n                                                       

A constant that leaves the address of the first (lowest) block buffer. 


FLD                    --- addr                            U

A user variable for control of number output field width.  Presently unused in 
Fig-FORTH. 


FORGET                                                  E,L0

Deletes definition named cccc from the dictionary with all entries physically 
following it.  In Fig-FORTH, an error message will occur if the CURRENT and 
CONTEXT vocabularies are not currently the same. 


FORTH                                                   P,L1

The name of the primary vocabulary.  Execution makes FORTH the CONTEXT vocabulary.
Until additional user vocabularies are defined, new user definitions become a part 
of FORTH.  FORTH is immediate, so it will execute during the creation of a 
colon-definition, to select this vocabulary at compile time. 


HERE                   --- addr                           L0

Leave the address of the next available dictionary location. 


HEX                                                       L0
