**Compiled and Completed Programs**

Once the program is fully debugged and running, a final run-time version can be
produced.  This is the only form in which programs generated from White Lightning
can be marketed.

If the program makes use of the foreground/background facility, ZAPINT should be
typed, if not, then ZAP should be typed.  The length of the compiled program is
then displayed until a key is pressed and control returned to BASIC to make a
copy.

The final program should be saved using:

SAVE "filename" CODE 24832, length

and executed using PRINT USR 24832.  Do not use RANDOMISE USR 24832.

Remember that a lot of run-time software is saved with your final code, so even if
your program is only two lines long, the resulting program will be pretty large.


                             **TABLE 1**
                  **Table of Screen Numbers and Addresses**


Screen           Start
Number          Address

   1             49664          Each screen used for editing
   2             50176          into consists of
   3             50688          8 lines x 64 characters
   4             51200                  = 512 bytes.
   5             51712
   6             52224
   7             52736          Therefore, if you have only
   8             53248          edited into screens 6-9,
   9             53760          then there is no need to save
  10             54272          ALL of the screens 1-22
  11             54784          since you only need save
  12             55296          from 52224 to 54271 (end of
  13             55808          screen 9), i.e. 2k bytes.
