Compiled and Completed Programs

Once the program is fully debugged and running, a final run-time version
can be produced. This is the only form in which programs generated from
White Lightning can be marketed.

If the program makes use of the foreground/background facility, ZAPINT
should be typed; if not, then ZAP should be typed. The length of the
compiled program is then displayed until a key is pressed and control
returned to BASIC to make a copy.

The final program should be saved using:
SAVE "filename" CODE 24832,length
and executed using PRINT USR 24832. Do not use RANDOMIZE USR 24832.

Remember that a lot of run-time software is saved with your final code, so
even if your program is only two lines long, the resulting program will be
pretty large.


TABLE 1
Table of Screen Numbers and Addresses

Each screen used for editing into consists of 8 lines x 64 characters =
512 bytes. Therefore, if you have only edited into screens 6-9, then there
is no need to save all of the screens 1-22, since you only need save from
52224 to 54271 (end of screen 9); ie. 2k bytes.
