THE PLAGUE OF CRABS

The crabs, sprite 33, are placed on the screen using PUTBLS.

The ROW and COL varables for the PUTBLS are loaded up each time by a random number
produced by using the Forth word RND.


THE BOUNCING BALL

This is a sprite or to be more precise, 4 sprites, moving in background.  The ball
is defined in four orientations to give half character resolution.  The movement
is obtained by doing a PUTXRS, calculating the next co-ordinates, blotting out the
old sprite with a second PUTXRS and then repeating the cycle. The listing for this
screen is given in section 3 under the heading - Programmable Sprites.


THE LUNAR SPACE SHIP

The radar dish on top of the space ship, sprite 34, is animated by sequentially
placing sprites 35 to 42, giving the effect of constant rotation.

Just before the spaceship takes off, an explosion, sprite 43, is XORed over the
spaceahlp using PUTXRS.  It is removed again by a second PUTXRS.

The spaceship is then scrolled up in a vertical window by 1 pixel.  The Lunar
surface, sprite 44, is also scolled by 1 pixel, to the right using WRR1V.


THE ROTATING BALLS

Four sprites were used to give the impression of rotation, these being sprites 45,
46, 47, and 48.

Once the sprites were created, animation was a simple process of sequentially
placing the sprites to the screen with an increasing and decreasing time delay
between each PUTBLS.


THE CREDITS

To achieve the text scrolling up from the bottom of the screen, the bottom line
was set with 0 INK and 0 PAPER colours, while the rest of the screen had 7 INK and
0 PAPER colours.

Each line of text was printed into that line and then the whole screen scrolled up
8 * 1 pixel, such that the text data scrolls into the screen that has 7 INK
attributes and thus appears to smoothly scroll onto the screen.
