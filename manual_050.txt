Command              Action

WIPE         Destroy a sprite and adjust memory


RELOCATE

An alternative method for creating more space to define new sprites, is to
relocate sprite space downward.  Only one parameter is required, MLEN.  A positive
value in MLEN will relocate sprites to high memory and a negative value will
relocate them downward.  All pointers are reset.


Parametcr             Use

MIEN          Size and direction of relocation


Command              Action

RELOCATE      Relocate all sprite data and reset pointers

Example:

If space for a 4 by 4 sprite is to be made and the existing buffer space
maintained, the sprites would need to be relocated downward by 4*4*9+5 = 149. To
do this use the following:

-149 MLEN ! RELOCATE


TEST

For advanced applications there is a arnnatul to interrogate sprite details.  SPN
is loaded with the number of the sprite to be interrogated, and after execution,
the following parameters will be set:

HGT   will hold the height of the sprite
LEN   will hold the width of the sprite
SPTR  will hold the address of the first byte of the sprite header
DPTR  will hold the address of the first byte of the pixel data
SIZE  will hold the amount of memory occupied by the sprite

In order to calculate the start of attribute data, use DPTR+8*HGT*LEN.  Note that
HGT, LEN, SPTR and DPTR will all be zero if the sprite wasn't found.

A true or false flag is also placed on the stack.  True means the sprite exists
and false means it doesn't.


Examples:

To see if sprite 34 exists, and print its dimensions if it does - use:

34 SPN ! TEST IF HGT ? LEN ? CR ENDIF
