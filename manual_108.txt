INDEX          from to ---                                                         

Print the first line of each screen over the range from, to.  This is used to view the comment lines of an area of text on disc screens. 


INTERPRET                                                                          

The outer text interpreter which sequentially executes or compiles text from the input stream (terminal or disc) depending on STATE.  If the word name cannot be found after a search of CONTEXT and then CURRENT it is converted to a number according to the current base.  That also failing, an error message echoing the name with a " ?" will be given.  Text input will be taken according to the convention for WORD.  If a decimal point is found as part of a number, a double number value will be left.  The decimal point has no other purpose than to force this action.  See NUMBER. 


KEY                    --- c                                                     L0

Leave the ascii value of the next terminal key struck. 


LATEST                 --- addr                                                    

Leave the name field address of the topmost word in the CURRENT vocabulary. 


LEAVE                                                                          C,L0

Force termination of a DO-LOOP at the next opportunity by setting the loop limit equal to the current value of the index.  The index itself remains unchanged, and execution proceeds normally until LOOP or +LOOP is encountered. 


LFA                pfa --- lfa                                                     

Convert the parameter field address of a dictionary definition to its link field address. 


LIMIT                  --- n                                                       

A constant leaving the address just above the highest memory available for a disc buffer.  Usually this is the highest system memory. 


LIST                 n ---                                                       L0

Display the ascii text of screen n on the selected output device.  SCR contains the screen number during and after this process.
