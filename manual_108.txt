INDEX          from to ---

Print the first line of each screen over the range from, to.  This is used to view
the comment lines of an area of text on disc screens.


INTERPRET

The outer text interpreter which sequentially executes or compiles text from the
input stream (terminal or disc) depending on STATE.  If the word name cannot be
found after a search of CONTEXT and then CURRENT, it is converted to a number
according to the current base.  That also failing, an error message echoing the
name with a "?" will be given.  Text input will be taken according to the
convention for WORD.  If a decimal point is found as part of a number, a double
number value will be left.  The decimal point has no other purpose than to force
this action.  See NUMBER.


KEY                    --- c                              L0

Leave the ASCII value of the next terminal key struck.


LATEST                 --- addr

Leave the name field address of the topmost word in the CURRENT vocabulary.


LEAVE                                                   C,L0

Force termination of a DO-LOOP at the next opportunity by setting the loop limit
equal to the current value of the index.  The index itself remains unchanged, and
execution proceeds normally until LOOP or +LOOP is encountered.


LFA                pfa --- lfa

Convert the parameter field address of a dictionary definition to its link field
address.


LIMIT                  --- n

A constant leaving the address just above the highest memory available for a disc
buffer.  Usually this is the highest system memory.


LINE                 n --- addr

Leave address of line n of current screen.  This address will be in the disc
buffer area


LIST                 n ---                                L0

Display the ASCII text of screen n on the selected output device.  SCR contains
the screen number during and after this process.
