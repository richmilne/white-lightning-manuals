Enlargement

One command is provided for enlarging a sprite and its attributes into a second
sprite which has dimensions exactly double those of the sprite being enlarged.


Parameter              Use

SP1          Number of the sprite into which the enlargement is carried
             out.
SP2          Number of the sprite being enlarged.


Command                Action

DSPM         Enlarge sprite SP2 into sprite SP1.

Note:

If the dimensions of sprite SP1 are not twice those of sprite SP2 the command will
not execute.


INTERRUPT RELATED WORDS

Six interrupt related words are provided which control the Foreground/Background
execution of White Lightning words.  The first four have no parameters.


Command                 Action

HALT        Suspend CPU operation until the next interrupt.  Executing
            HALT in background mode will freeze the system permanently.

EI          Enable the interrupt.

DI          Disable the interrupt.

EXX         Exchange IDEAL variables with the alternate IDEAL variables.
            This command is executed automatically each time an
            interrupt occurs and at the end of the interrupt routine
            to restore foreground variables.  If a background program
            is not being used EXX can be used to provide extra variables.

INT-ON      The specified word (see next example) is executed on the
            receipt of each interrupt.

INT-OFF     Following execution of INT-0FF the Z8O returns to interrupt
            mode 1 and polls the keyboard 50 times a second.  The
            background program ceases execution.

Example:

To set a word running in background type:

' WORD INT-ON

Where "WORD" is the word to be run in background.
