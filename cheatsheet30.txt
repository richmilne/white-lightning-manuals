Before a cartridge can be used to stor sprites, it has to be specially
formatted. This is done using the Sprite Generator Program by typing
SYMBOL SHIFT F (TO). This will format the cartridge and set up five dummy
files, numbered 1 to 5. From now on, whenever you save a file of sprites,
the old file of that number will be erased to conserve cartridge storage
space.

For example, if you wished to save a file of sprites currently in memory,
to file 1, use:

1. Type SYMBOL SHIFT S (save sprites).
2. Type N              (we don't want tape).
3. Type Y              (save to drive).
4. Insert the formatted cartridge.
5. Press any key.
6. Type 1              (save to file 1).

To load sprites just press SYMBOL SHIFT J and then follow the same
sequence as that used to save.


AVAILABLE MEMORY

You have 13595 bytes available for sprites. Please note that the bottom
2816 bytes, locations 51685 to 54501 are used to store the arcade
character library accesses by the 'Z' key. If, by creating lots of
sprites, you overwrite this area of memory, you should nor try to access
any of these characters.


CREATION OF LARGE SPRITES

The microdrive version of the Sprite Development Package allowd the
creation of large sprites (larger than the 15x15 screen) in memory. These
sprites can be said to be empty when created and have to be filled by
placing smaller sprites into them using the 'place sprite into sprite
window' function (BREAK SPACE key).

To create a large sprite hit CAPS SHIFT C and enter the dimensions as
instructed.


MERGING SPRITES FROM MICRODRIVE

The actual microdrive file that contains the sprite data has the capital
letter B after it (CHR$ 66) such that, for example, the sprite data for
sprite file '5' is file '5B'.

So with reference to line 5 on page 81 of the White Lightning manual; to
merge from microdrive the sprites of sprite file 5 in White Lightning,
exit to BASIC and then type:
	LOAD *"M";1;"5B" CODE
