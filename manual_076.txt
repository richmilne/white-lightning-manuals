THE BASIC INTERFACE

The BASIC interface was provided to increase the flexibility of the language and 
allow the newcomer to Forth, a gradual transition.  Some applications are actually
more suited to BASIC but for games writing in general, Forth is much more 
appropriate and we hope that this facility will not discourage people from 
experimenting with Forth.

There are four words to master at the Forth end and 3 USR calls to master at the
BASIC end.  Do not use CLEAR or NEW whilst in BASIC.


The Command Level

When White Lightning is first entered from a COLD start, BASIC is located beneath 
Forth and there is approximately 1k of program space if microdrives are not in 
use.  This is ample space if BASIC is only to be used at command level, to LOAD 
and SAVE for instance, but if programs are to be written you will need to execute 
the RESERVE command.  For the time being, however, let's just consider operation 
at the command level.  To enter BASIC from Forth type:

PROG <CR>

To re-enter Forth from BASIC just use:

PRINT USR 24836 <CR>

This is the normal WARM start entry.  Note that PRINT USR must be used and not 
RANDOMIZE USR, or an OUT OF SCREEN error may occur.


BASIC AS A SUBROUTINE

At the next level, lines of BASIC can be executed as if they were subroutines and 
then return made to your Forth program.  The word at the Forth end is GOTO.  To 
return to Forth and continue execution use PRINT USR 30006.

To begin with, space needs to be made in the dictionary for the basic program. 
The word used to do this is RESERVE.  What RESERVE actually does, is to make space
 in the dictionary and reset BASIC's system variables to point to this new area. 
This does mean, however, that if a second reserve is done, without FORGETting the 
old space, then the old space is lost and can never be re-accessed.  Do not 
execute a Forth COLD start while BASIC is reserved or a RAMTOP error may occur if 
insufficient memory is reserved.  Always execute PROG as the next command after 
RESERVE.

As an example, try the following:

DECIMAL 2000 RESERVE PROG <CR>

This will set up the BASIC space and then enter it at command mode.  The following
lines of BASIC can now be entered:

1000 PRINT "LINE 1000 OF BASIC" : PRINT USR 30006
2000 PRINT "LINE 2000 OF BASIC"
2010 FOR I = 1 TO 8 : PRINT I : NEXT I
2020 PRINT USR 30006
