T        Activates the TEST SPRITE function.
         Performs a test on the sprite whose number is held in the "Sprite
         Number" variable, and does the following:

         1.  Places the sprite height into the "Sprite height" variable.
         2.  Places the sprite length into the "Sprite length" variable.
         3.  Places the address in memory of where the sprite data starts,
             into the "Sprite" variable.
         4.  Places the address of the start of sprite space into the variable
             "SPST"
         5.  Places the address of the end of sprite space into the
             variable "SPND".
         6.  Calculates the remaining memory available for sprite
             storage and places it into the "Memory Left" variable.

         NOTE:  The screen display of these variables will be updated
         if necessary.

U        Activates the PICK UP ATTRIBUTES function.
         Picks up the attributes of the character from the sprite screen,
         indicated by the position of the sprite screen cursors and
         Loads them into the four Attribute variables.

V        Activates the FLASH variable. This is one of the four attributes.
         Press 1 to put switch ON.
         Press 0 to put switch OFF.

W        Activates the WIPE SPRITE function.
         Wipes the sprite indicated by the "Sprite number" variable
         totally from memory.  All other sprites stored in memory below
         that sprite are moved up to fill the space previously
         occupied by the Wiped sprite.

X        Activate the INK variable which is one of the four attributes.
         Press any key between 0 and 7 to set the colour indicated
         above the key.

Y        Activates the YES, positive response to (Y/N) questions.

Z        Activates the pre-defined ARCADE CHARACTER function.
         Place a pre-defined Arcade Character to the sprite screen.
         The top left hand corner of the character is indicated by
         the sprite screen cursors.  Input a number between 1 and 167
         followed by ENTER.

         NOTE:  Each character, with its number, can be seen on the Demo B
         tape.  A list is given at the back of this section.

NOT      Activates the SAVE SPRITES TO TAPE facility.
(SYMBOL  Place a suitable cassette in your cassette recorder and
SHIFT    position as desired.  Press NOT, enter your filename (1 to 8
S)       characters).  The program will save three groups of data;
         an array and two sections of code.
         After SAVEing, you will be asked to rewind the tape and VERIFY -
         be sure to only press PLAY on your cassette recorder.
         If the programs VERIFY, the Sprite Development Program will
         return to command level with the Text Line cleared.

         NOTE:  If the program breaks because of failure to VERIFY,
         type GOTO 3 and execute a WARM START; your data will not be lost.
