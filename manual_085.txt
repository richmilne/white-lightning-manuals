         NOTE:  ATTR = 0 leaves the attributes of the sprite as they are.
         ATTR = 1 takes the attributes from the screen and places them
         into the sprite.

         1 GETORS, ORs the screen data with the pre-defined sprite, and
         leaves the result in the sprite (screen display unaffected).

         2 GETXRS, XORs the screen data with the data of a pre-defined
         sprite, and leaves the result in the sprite, (screen
         display unaffected).

         3 GETNDS, ANDs the screen data with the data of a pre-defined 
         sprite, and leaves the result in the sprite (screen display
         unaffected).


p        Activates the PUT functions. 
         You will be given four options.  Each option PUTS a sprite
         whose number is Specified in the variable "Sprite Number" onto
         the sprite screen, having a top left-hand corner at the sprite 
         screen cursor positions.

         NOTE:  ATTR = 0 leaves the Screen Attributes unaffected.
         ATTR = 1 PUTs sprite Attributes to the sprite Screen.
       
         1 PUTBLS is a straightforward PUT, placing data directly to
         the sprite screen, destroying anything that is on that part of
         the screen (Sprite unaffected).
       
         2 PUTORS, ORs the sprite data with the data on the sprite screen,
         leaving the result on the screen (Sprite unaffected).
       
         3 PUTXRS, XORs the sprite data with the data on the sprite screen,
         leaving the result on the screen (Sprite unaffected).
       
         4 PUTNDS, ANDs the sprite data with the data on the sprite screen,
         leaving the result on the screen (Sprite unaffected).

O        Activates the CLEAR CHR$ SQR function.  Sets all CHR$ SQR bits
         to zero.

SYMBOL   Activates the CLEAR SPRITE SCREEN function.  Clears the sprite
SHIFT    screen of all data and attributes.
Q
(<=)

R        Activates the ROTATE SPRITE function.
         Rotates a sprite, in memory, by 90 degrees, leaving the original
         sprite unaffected.  The new Rotated sprite must be given a new 
         sprite numoer, as asked for.  Attributes are autanatically
         Rotated with the pixel data.

S        Activates the SPRITE NUMBER variable.
         Permits the defining of sprites and asks for a sprite number in
         the range 1 to 255

         NOTE:  If a sprite to be defined is given an existing sprite 
         number, a warning is displayed, advising you of this fact.  The 
         existing sprite, or the new sprite, are in no way corrupted.
