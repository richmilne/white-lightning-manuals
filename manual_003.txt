TO THE NEWCOMER

When you have run the demonstration tape and have seen what can be done, this may
give you the incentive to learn all you can to produce full specification games
for yourself.  The author of this manual knew nothing of White Lightning before
starting this project, but can promise you that after only a few hours of
experimentation, became fairly adept and had the confidence to want to go further.
It may all look a little complicated at first, but please be assured, that after a
short time, and only a little effort, the fog really does clear!
