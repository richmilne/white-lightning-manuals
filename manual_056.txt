Command                Action

ATTON    Enable the flow of attribute data between the sprite and the screen
         window
ATTOFF   Disable the flow of attributes between the sprite and the screen
         window

We now come to the group 1 commands themselves:


GETS

Parameter                 Use

SPN          Number of the sprite to be used (1 to 255)
COL          Left hand column of target screen window (0 to 31)
ROW          Top row of target screen window (0 to 23)

Ccmmand                Action

GETBLS       Block move screen window into sprite
GETORS       OR screen window into sprite
GETXRS       XOR screen window into sprite
GETNDS       AND screen window into sprite

Note:

The dimensions of the screen window are taken as the dimensions of the sprite.  If
the command doesn't execute, it is almost certainly because the width of the
sprite + COL or the height of the sprite + ROW, exceed 32 or 24 respectively, so
that part of the window lies off the screen.  sprites must be previously set up
either by the development software, or the COLD# and SPRITE or ISPRITE commands
before these commands will execute.

Example:

To GET a screen sprite into sprite number 4 from column 5, row 4, with attributes
and "OR" it with the data currently held in sprite number 4, use the following:

4 SPN ! 5 COL ! 4 ROW ! ATT0N GETORS

Note that if ATTON was the last switch command, it would not be needed in the
above.


PUTS

These commands are identical to the group 1 "GETS" except that data transfer is
from the sprite to the screen.  The results of the various operations are
therefore displayed to the screen.  The parameters are identical in operation to
those of the "GETS", and the ATT0N and ATTOFF switch commands also apply.


Parameter                 Use

SPN         Number of the sprite to he used (l to 255)
COL         Left hand column of target screen window (0 to 31)
ROW         Top row of target screen window (0 to 23)
