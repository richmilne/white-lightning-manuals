Now one of the interesting properties of the logical XOR, is that if the operation
is repeated, the original character is restored - to mend the Robot:

1.  Press P(PUT) and enter 3 - a fully restored Robot!


Well, there you have it.  In fact, the only functions remaining that have not been
covered by an example are:

1.  Relocate Sprites  ( < (SYMBOL SHIFT R) ).

2.  Save sprites to Tape ( NOT (SYMBOL SHIFT S) ).

3.  Load Sprites from Tape ( - (SYMBOL SHIFT J) ).

The "Relocate Sprites" does simply that, it relocates sprites in memory.  Just
enter a relocation length - positive to move srites to higher memory and negative
to move sprites to lower memory.  This function is not often used in fact and
should be used with great care!

The "Save Sprites" function is very straight forward - just follow the screen
instructions.  After the sprites have been saved you will be asked to rewind the
tape to verify the saved data.

The "Load Sprites" function is similar to the above - just follow the screen
instructions.

It should be noted that whenever sprites are saved or loaded, there are 3 distinct
sets of data which the generator stores and retrieves.


CONCLUSIONS

Well, there's nothing to stop you now!  Going through the examples will help you
to familiarise yourself with all of the Function Keys.  It won't be long before
you'll be happy to press on by yourself - happy sprite generating.

The thing to do now, is to press on with Spectra Forth and IDEAL, these really are
not as frightening as they may first appear - after seeing the demo program, what
more incentive do you need !
