COUNT            addr1 --- addr2 n                                               L0

Leave the byte address addr2 and byte count n of a message text beginning at address addr1.  It is presumed that the first byte at addr1 contains the text byte count and the actual text starts with the second byte.  Typically COUNT is followed by TYPE. 


CR                                                                               L0

Transmit a carriage return and line feed to the selected output device. 


CREATE                                                                             

A defining word used in the form:
                   CREATE cccc
by such words as CODE and CONSTANT to create a dictionary header for a Forth definition.  The code field contains the address of the words parameter field.  The new word is created in the CURRENT vocabulary. 


CSP                    --- addr                                                   U

A user variable temporarily storing the stack pointer position, for compilation error checking. 


D+               d1 d2 --- dsum                                                    

Leave the double number sum of two double numbers. 


D+-               d1 n --- d2                                                      

Apply the sign of n to the double number d1, leaving it as d2. 


D.                   d ---                                                       L1

Print a signed double number from a 32 bit two's complement value.  The high-order l6 bits are most accessable on the stack.  Conversion is performed according to the current BASE.  A blank follows.  Pronounced D-dot. 


D.R                d n ---                                                         

Print a signed double number d right aligned in a field n characters wide. 


DABS                 d --- ud                                                      

Leave the absolute value ud of a double number. 


DECIMAL                                                                          L0

Set the numeric conversion BASE for decimal input-output.
