Command                Action

PUTBLS      Block move sprite window into screen
PUTORS      OR sprite window into screen
PUTXRS      XOR sprite window into screen
PUTNDS      AND sprite window into screen


Group 2


These commands allow operations between sprite windows and screen windows.  Unlike
Group 1 commands, there are separate commands to move pixel data and attributes,
and the ATTON, ATTOFF commands have no effect on their operation.  Two new
parameters are introduced to specify the COLUMN and ROW of the top left hand
character of the sprite window.  In addition, HGT and LEN are required to specify
the dimensions of the window for the screen and sprite.


Parameters                  Use

COL          Left hand column of target screen window (0 to 31)
ROW          Top row of target screen window (0 to 23)
SCOL         Left hand column of target sprite window (0 to sprite width -1)
SROR         Top row of target sprite window (0 to sprite height -1)
HGT          Height of window
LEN          Length of window
SPN          Sprite number


Command                    Action

GWBLS        Get block of pixel data from screen window into sprite window
GWORS        OR pixel data from screen window into sprite window
GWXRS        XOR pixel data from screen window into sprite window
GWNDS        AND pixel data from screen window into sprite window
GWATTS       GET block of attribute data from screen window into sprite window
PWBLS        PUT block of pixel data from screen window into sprite window
PWORS        OR pixel data from sprite window into screen window
PWXRS        XOR pixel data from sprite window into screen window
PWNDS        AND pixel data from sprite window into screen window
PWATTS       PUT block of attribute data from sprite window into screen window

Note:

If the command does not execute, check that the window is not partially off the
screen or sprite.

Example:

To block move a window 3 characters high and 4 characters wide from row 2, column
3 of the screen to row 4, column 6 of sprite number 7, use the following:

7 SPN ! 3 HGT ! 4 LEN ! 2 ROW ! 3 COL ! 4 SROW ! 6 SCOL ! GWBLS

Note that sprite 7 must be at least 8 characters wide and 7 characters high for
the command to execute.
