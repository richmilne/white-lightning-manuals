DP                     --- addr                          U,L

A user variable, the dictionary pointer, which contains the address of the next 
free memory above the dictionary.  The value may be read by HERE and altered by 
ALLOT. 


DPL                    --- addr                         U,L0

A user variable containing the number of digits to the right of the decimal on 
double integer input.  It may also be used hold output column location of a 
decimal point, in user generated formating.  The default value on single number 
input is -1. 


DROP                 n ---                                L0

Drop the number from the stack. 


DUMP              addr ---                                L0

Print the contents of n memory locations beginning at addr.  Both addresses and 
contents are shown in the current numeric base. 


DUP                  n --- n n                            L0

Duplicate the value on the stack. 


ELSE          addr1 n1 --- addr2 n2 (compiling)      P,C2,L0

Occurs within a colon-definition within the form:
              IF  ...  ELSE  ...  ENDIF
At run-time, ELSE executes after the true part following IF.  ELSE forces the 
execution to skip over the following false part, and resumes execution after the 
ENDIF.  It has no stack effect. 
 
A compile time ELSE emplaces branch reserving a branch offset, leaves the address 
addr2 and n2 for error treating.  ELSE also resolves the pending forward branch 
from IF by calculating the offset from addr1 to HERE and storing at addr1. 


EMIT                 c ---                                L0

Transmit ASCII character c to the selected output device.  OUT is incremented for 
each character output. 


EMPTY-BUFFERS                                             L0

Mark all block-buffers as empty, not necessarily affecting the contents.  Updated 
blocks are not written to the disc.  This is also an initialization procedure 
before first use of the disc.
