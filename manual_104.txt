DP                     --- addr                                                 U,L

A user variable, the dictionary pointer, which contains the address of the next free memory above the dictionary.  The value may be read by HERE and altered by ALLOT. 


DPL                    --- addr                                                U,L0

A user variable containing the number of digits to the right of the decimal on double integer input.  It may also be used hold output column location of a decimal point, in user generated formating.  The default value on mingle number input is -1. 


DR0                                                                                
DR1                                                                                

Installation dependent commands to select disc drives, by presetting OFFSET.  The contents of OFFSET is added to the block number in BLOCK to allow for this selection.  Offset is suppressed for error text so that is may always originate from drive 0. 


DROP                 n ---                                                       L0

Drop the number from the stack. 


DUMP            addr n ---                                                       L0

Print the contents of n memory locations beginning at addr.  Both addresses and contents are shown in the current numeric base. 


DUP                  n --- n n                                                   L0

Duplicate the value on the stack. 


ELSE          addr1 n1 --- addr2 n2 (compiling)                             P,C2,L0

Occurs within a colon-definition in the form:
                 IF ...  ELSE ...  ENDIF
At run-time, ELSE executes after the true part following IF.  ELSE forces execution to skip over the following false part and resumes execution after the ENDIF.  It has no stack effect. 
 
At compile-time ELSE emplaces BRANCH reserving a branch offset, leaves the address addr2 and n2 for error testing.  ELSE also resolves the pending forward branch from IF by calculating the offset from addr1 to HERE and storing at addr1. 


EMIT                 c ---                                                       L0

Transmit ascii character c to the selected output device.  OUT is incremented for each character output. 


EMPTY-BUFFERS                                                                    L0

Mark all block-buffers as empty, not necessarily affecting the contents.  Updated blocks are not written to the disc.  This is also an initialization procedure before first use of the disc.
