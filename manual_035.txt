9 CLEAR [CR]

This sets the current screen to 9. To insert text use the EDIT command.
Type 0 EDIT [CR] followed by the text below:
THIS IS HOW TO PUT [CR]

Then type:
1 EDIT [CR]
TEXT ON LINE 1 [CR]
and so on, until you have entered:
0 THIS IS HOW TO PUT [CR]
1 TEXT ON LINE 1 [CR]
2 LINE 2 [CR]
3 AND LINE 3 OF THIS SCREEN [CR]

9 LIST will produce:

SCR # 9
0 THIS IS HOW TO PUT
1 TEXT ON LINE 1
2 LINE 2
3 AND LINE 3 OF THIS SCREEN
4
5
6
7

To change line 2, type EDIT 2 [CR] and then change it in the normal way to
insert 'TEXT ON' before 'LINE 2'. Now type 9 LIST [CR] to see the result.
The editor ignores characters after the 64th character of the line being
edited.

If you have a Sinclair printer connected, then it is probably worth
defining a word to list screens to the printer:
: SLIST PRT-ON 1+ SWAP DO I LIST CR LOOP PRT-OFF ;

To use the above word, type the first screen number, last screen number,
SLIST; eg.:
6 9 SLIST [CR] will list screens 6-9 to the printer.


FORTH ERROR MESSAGES

lee following error messages may occur, and will be printed out in the form I•REU 1 MSG 40 standing for FRED ? ERROR MESSAGE K1A1BER 0•


# 0 - this means that a word could not be found, or that a numeric conversion could not take place.

e.g. 109Z <CR>
# 1 - this indicates an empty stack and will be encountered when trying to take more values from the stack than exist. Try:

:'17:5T1 1000 0 DO ?STACK CROP LOOP ;<CR>
'rts•rl <CR>
35
tsfxx is a word which tests the stack for out or mounds.


A 2 - this indicates that either the dictionary has grown up to meet the stack (dictionary full) or that the stack has grown down to meet the dictionary.

Try:    :'It>r2 1000 0 00 ?STACK 0 0 0 0 0 IDOP ;<CR> TEST2 <CR>


Y 4 - this means that you have redefined an existing word using a new colon definition

Try:    : ROT ." NEW OEF'II7ITION " ; <Q2>

This is not really an error since the new word is still valid, but the old definition cannot be accessed unless you FORGET the new one.


1 6 - this error my occur when editing, loading or listing screens of data.

Try:    25 LIST <Q2>
This will produce MSGA6 and means you have tried to access a non-existent screenful of memory.


Y 9 - this indicates that an attempt was made to clear sprite space of less than 2 bytes.


A 10 - this indicates that one of the IDEAL words made reference to a sprite which did not exist, or that an attempt uss mode to insert a sprite using ISPRITE with a number previously allocated to an existing sprite.


W 17 - this will occur if you try to use a word in the 'immediate' mode which should only be used during compilation, i.e. during colon definitions. For a list of such words, refer to the glossary (words with "C" in the top right hand corner of the description).

Try:    DO <CR> IF «R>


A 18 - this occurs if a word meant for execution only, is put within a colon definition (~rds with "H" in the top right hand corner of the -description).


# 19 - this :mans that a colon definition contains conditionals that have not been paired.

e.g.    a LOOP without a 00
an FNDIF without an IF

Try:    : TEST3 ELSE ." td20IS', " ; <CR>
# 20 - this occurs if a colon definition has not been properly finished. Try:    : TEST4 IF ." OK ^ ; <CR>
