9 CLEAR <CR>

This sets the current screen to 9.  To insert text use the EDIT command. Type 0 EDIT <CR> followed by the text below:

THIS IS HOW TO PUT <CR>

Then type 1 EDIT <CR>

TEXT ON LINE 1 <CR>

and so on, until you have entered:

0 THIS IS HOW TO PUT <CR> 1 TEXT ON LINE 1 <CR> 2 LINE 2 <CR>
3 AND LINE 3 OF THIS SCREEN <CR>

9 LIST will produce:

SCR # 9
0  THIS IS HOW TO PUT 1  TEXT ON LINE 1 2  LINE 2
3  AND LINE 3 OF THIS SCREEN 4
5
6
7

To change LINE 2, type 2 EDIT <CR> and then change it in the normal way to insert 'TEXT ON' before 'LINE 2'.  Now type 9 LIST <CR> to see the result.  The editor ignores characters after the 64th character of the line being edited.

If you have a Sinclair printer connected, then it is probably worth defining a word to list screens to the printer:

: SLIST PRT-ON 1+ SWAP DO I LIST CR LOOP PRT-OFF ;

To use the above word, type the first screen number, last screen number, SLIST.

e.g.  6 9 SLIST <CR> will list screens 6-9 to the printer.


FORTH ERROR MESSAGES

The following error messages may occur, and will be printed out in the form FRED ? MSG #0   standing for FRED ? ERROR MESSAGE NUMBER 0 .


 # 0  -  this means that a word could not be found, or that a numeric conversion
         could not take place.

e.g.  109Z <CR>


 # 1  -  this indicates an empty stack and will be encountered when trying to
         take more values from the stack than exist. Try:

        : TEST1  1000  0  DO  ?STACK  DROP LOOP  ; <CR>
          TESTl <CR>
