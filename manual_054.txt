SPRITE SCROLLS

The format for these commands is similar to that for the screen scrolls, except
that these commands are postflred with an M as opposed to a V.


Horizontal Scrolls

Parameters            Use

SPN        The number of the sprite to be scrolled (1 to 255)

Command             Actions

WRL1M      Scroll left  1 pixel  with wrap
WRR1M      Scroll right 1 pixel  with wrap
SCL1M      Scroll left  1 pixel,   no wrap
SCR1M      Scroll right 1 pixel,   no wrap
WRL4M      Scroll left  4 pixels with wrap
WRR4M      Scroll right 4 pixels with wrap
SCL4M      Scroll left  4 pixels,  no wrap
SCR4M      Scroll right 4 pixels,  no wrap
WRL8M      Scroll left  8 pixels with wrap
WRR8M      Scroll right 8 pixels with wrap
SCL8M      Scroll left  8 pixels,  no wrap
SCR8M      Scroll right 8 pixels,  no wrap

Note:

The chief purpose of these commands is to give pixel resolution to the PUT
command, and for this reason, a 1 character border along 2 edges of a sprite
character should always be allowed.

Example:

To scroll sprite number 7, 1 pixel right with wrap, use:

7 SPN ! WRR1M

Vertical Scrolls

These work in the same way as the vertical screen scrolls where the signed
variable NPX is used to determine the size and direction of the scroll.

Parameters            Use

SPN           Number of the sprite to be scrolled
NPX           Number of pixels to be scrolled
