SPRITE/SPRITE OPERATIONS

These are operations between sprites which usually have the same dimensions, or,
as in the case of the SPIN command, transposed dimensions.  SP1 and SP2 hold the
sprite numbers.  Commands in this group are postfixed with a "M", e.g. COPORM,
SPINM.


DUMMY SPRITE

A dummy sprite is a sprite which does not contain data for display.  It may be
used, for instance, to store a machine code subroutine, an array, or maybe a
collision detection sprite.


IDEAL VARIABLES

The IDEAL sublanguage uses 27 variables in all, these are:

VARIABLE                              USE

ROW          Used to hold the row (Y co-ord) in characters, measured
             from the top of the screen (0-23).

LEN          Used to hold the width of the current screen window
             (1-32), or the width of the sprite being defined (1-255).
             Units are characters.

COL          Used to hold the column (X co-ord) in characters, measured
             from the left of the screen (0-31).

HGT          Used to hold the height of the current screen window
             (1-24), or the height of the sprite being defined (1-255).
             Units are characters.

SROW         Used to hold the row (Y co-ord) within the sprite whose
             number is held in SP2, measured from the top (0-(HGT-1)).
             Units are characters.

SCOL         Used to hold the column (X co-ord) within the sprite
             whose number is held in SP2, measured from the left
             (0-(LEN-1)).  Units are characters.

NPX          Used to hold the size and direction of the vertical scrolls.
             Positive scrolls are upward and negative downward.
             Units are pixels and not characters.

SPN          Used to hold the sprite number for those words which
             operate on only one sprite (1-255).

SP1          Where operations involve a sprite and a sprite window,
             SP1 holds the number of the sprite which does not contain
             the window (1-255).  Where a sprite is to be spun into a
             second sprite, SP1 holds the number of the first sprite
             (1-255).

SP2          Where operations involve a sprite and a sprite window,
             SP2 holds the number of the sprite which does contain
             the window (1-255).  Where a sprite is to be spun into a second
             sprite, SP2 holds the number of the second sprite
             (1-255).
