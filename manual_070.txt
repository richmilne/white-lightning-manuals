Now type:

: IRUN ICNT @ DUP DUP DUP <CR>
F1 MOD ABS PHl = IF INVV ENDIF <CR>
F2 MOD ABS PH2 = IF MIRV ENDIF <CR>
F3 MOD ABS PH3 = IF WRR1V ENDIF <CR>

1 ICNT +! ; <CR>

This can be executed using VLIST ' IRUN INT-0N <CR>

Forth/BASIC Words

Sinclair's graphics and sound commands have been replicated as Forth words for 
continuity - they also execute slightly more rapidly than their BASIC 
counterparts.  For a full list, see the section on Forth/BASIC WORDS.

They all execute code in Sinclair's own ROM which, unlike Forth and IDEAL, is not 
re-entrant.  This means that these words cannot be executed in foreground and 
background simultaneously.  The FORTH words ." , . and U. should also not be 
executed simultanteously with themselves or any of the BASIC words.  None of the 
Forth/BASIC words, ." , . or U. should be executed in background while Forth is in 
command mde.
