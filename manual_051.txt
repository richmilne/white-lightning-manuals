**ISPRITE AND DSPRITE**

it sprites are located at the top of memory, then ISPRITE and DSPRITE can be used
to create and destroy sprites without the need for any complex calculations.
ISPRITE will insert a sprite at the top of memory, maintain the buffer space and
automatically relocate the rest of sprite space downward.  DSPRITE will destroy an
old sprite and relocate sprite space upward.  The easiest way to use this package
is to leave the buffer space as it is, then just use ISPRITE and DSPRITE to CREATE
and DESTROY sprites.  SPRITE, WIPE, COLD# and RELOCATE are for advanced
applications where sprites are created during program execution.  If a "ZAPPED"
program were to execute ISPRITE the sprites would extend downwards and could
overwrite the object code of the main program which lies just beneath SPST.  If a
program runs before being "ZAPPED", but the final run-time version crashes, this
is where to look !


Parameter              Use

SPN          Number of the sprite to be inserted
HGT          Height of the sprite to be inserted
LEN          Length of the sprite be be inserted


Command              Action

**ISPRITE**      Create new sprite and adjust memory


Parameter             Use

SPN          Number of sprite to be inserted


Command              Action

**DSPRITE**      Wipe old sprite and adjust memory


Note:

Be sure sufficient memory is available before executing ISPRITE.  SPST holds the
start; after execution, SPST will became SPST - 9*HGT*LEN-5.
