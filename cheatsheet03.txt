: MAKE 62 SPN ! 4 HGT ! 4 LEN ! TEST 0= IF ISPRITE CLSM ENDIF ;

This will create and clear sprite 62.  Now use:

1 SCOL ! 1 SROW ! 62 SP2 ! 24 SP1 ! GWBLM

Sprite 62 is now set up ready for use.  We now need four words to move the sprite
UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT.

: UP    7 1 KB IF ROW @  0 > MINUS ROW +! ENDIF ;
: DOWN  8 1 KB IF ROW @ 20 < ROW +! ENDIF ;
: LEFT  1 1 KB IF COL @  0 > MINUS COL +! ENDIF ;
: RIGHT 1 2 KB IF COL @ 28 < COL +! ENDIF ;

The ENTER and SPACE keys will move the sprite up and down and CAPS SHIFT and Z
will move the sprite left and right respectively.

The full word to animate the sprite becomes:

: TESTC 62 SPN ! 10 COL ! 10 ROW ! BEGIN UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT ADJM PWBLS 6 1 KB
UNTIL ;

To exit TEST we press the key at 6 1, this is the "P" key.

If you're using the source at the end of this section type 7 LOAD MAKE TESTC.  The
great limitation of this routine, however, is that data already on the screen will
be replaced by the sprite being PUT and subsequently lost.  Before considering the
more sophisticated methods available to us which overcome this limitation let's
just consider some simpler methods of circumventing this problem, which will work
for similar situations.

Supposing the screen holds half a dozen or so fixed objects and we wish to move
the invader in the last example through these objects.

First of all let's set up a screen with these objects scattered throughout.

: SETUP 4 SPN ! 3 2 4 5 6 3 5 12 10 9 12 14 6 0 DO ROW ! COL ! PUTRS LOOP ;

Notice that we use the PUTORS word to OR data to the screen; the reason for this
will become clear.

We'll now redefine UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT so that sprite 62 is only 'PUT' if it
is moved, the new code becomes:

: KCHK KB DUP ROT OR SWAP ;
: UP    7 1 KCHK IF ROW @  0 > MINUS ROW +! ENDIF ;
: DOWN  8 1 KCHK IF ROW @ 20 < ROW +! ENDIF ;
: LEFT  1 1 KCHK IF COL @  0 > MINUS COL +! ENDIF ;
: RIGHT 1 2 KCHK IF COL @ 28 < COL +! ENDIF ;

The complete word becomes:

: TESTD CLS BEGIN COL @ ROW @ SETUP ROW ! COL ! 62 SPN ! @ UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT IF
ADJM PWBLS ENDIF 6 1 KB UNTIL ;

What is happening is that as soon as the moving sprite is PUT to the screen all
screen data is immediately "OR"ed so that if any was blotted out, it is
immediately replaced.  Type "P" to exit.

To use the source code listings type 8 LOAD TESTD
