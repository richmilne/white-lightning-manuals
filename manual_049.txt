A dummy sprite 6 by 8 is also required for the rotation so:

 1  6 by 8 sprite requires       1*(6*8*9+5) =  437 bytes

So the overall total is          2986+27+437 = 3450 bytes

If this is to be located at the top of memory, then SPST will need to be set to
65520 - 3450 = 62070.  Note that memory 65520 to 65536 is used for background
applications.

In this case you would use the following:

62070 SPST ! 3450 SLEN ! COLD#

SPND will be automatically set to 62070.

If all this seems a bit complicated, don't worry.  A far simpler way of setting up
sprites is to use the ISPRITE and DSPRITE commands described later in this
section.  You won't even need to execute a COLD# command.


SPRITE

Once the sprite space has been cleared, the sprites themselves can be set up.

Parameters                 Use

SPN           Number of the sprite to be set up
HGT           Height of the sprite in characters
LEN           Width of the sprite in characters


Command                  Action

SPRITE        The five byte leader is set up and SPND adjusted

Note:

If space is dynamically allocated to a sprite, the sprite will not necessarily be
initialised and may contain garbage.  If a sprite is being set up at run-time, be
sure that sufficient memory is available.  If a sprite number is given that has
been previously used, the old sprite is destroyed and recreated with the new
dimensions.  If sufficient memory is not available, then either an old sprite can
be destroyed or the whole of sprite space can be relocated downwards if space is
available.  Most users will probably not use the SPRITE command, but instead, will
use the far simpler ISPRITE command.


WIPE

This command will destroy the sprite whose number is held in SPN, relocate the
sprites above it downward, update the variable SPND (marking the end of sprite
space) and leave the particular sprite number free for reallocation.


Parameter               Use

SPND          The number of the sprite to be wiped
