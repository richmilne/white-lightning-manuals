LOGICAL OPERATIONS

There are three types of logical operation included in the IDEAL sub-language; 
these are OR, XOR and AND.  To get the best out of this package it is important to 
make full use of these commands.

If a GET or PUT postfixed with "BLS" or "BLM" is executed,  then data is block 
moved from the source which may be part of the screen, a sprite, or a sprite 
window, in such a way that whatever was previously held at the destination which 
may also be part of the screen, a sprite, or a sprite window, is obliterated and 
replaced by whatever was at the source.  This may not always be the desired effect 
and quite often the user will want to merge characters or remove parts of the 
characters and so on.

If two sprites are "OR"ed together, the resulting sprite will have pixels set 
where pixels were set in either or both of the sprites being "OR"ed.

If two sprites are "AND"ed together, the resulting sprite will have pixels set 
where pixels were set in both of the sprites being "AND"ed.

If two sprites are "XOR"ed together, the resulting sprite will have pixels set 
where pixels were set in either but reset where pixels were set or reset in both.

These results are summarised as follows and should make things a little clearer:


SOURCE         DESTINATION         OPERATION        RESULT

  on               on                 OR              on   
  on               off                OR              on
  off              on                 OR              on
  off              off                OR              off

  on               on                 OR              on
  on               off                OR              off
  off              on                 OR              off
  off              off                OR              off

  on               on                 XOR             off
  on               off                XOR             on
  off              on                 XOR             on
  off              off                XOR             off


We can now use the sample sprites to illustrate the effects of these operations. 
First FORGET any previously defined words and type: DECIMAL <CR> to ensure that 
you are in decimal mode. Now type:

7 INK 0 PAPER CLS ." LOGICAL OR " CR ." LOGICAL OR " <CR>

This will clear the screen and put some data in the top left hand corner.

Now type:

3 SPN ! 0 COL ! 0 ROW 1 ATTOFF PUTORS <CR>

You will see that the data has been merged together, both the dragster and the 
letters remain.
