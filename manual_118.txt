NOOP                   ---

This will perform a no-operation, i.e. do nothing.


WARM->COLD

This allows you to preserve any FORTH word defined to date, so that a COLD start
will not delete them.  When saving your code, save from 24832 to HERE.

e.g.  : NEWWORD ." THIS WILL BE PRESERVED BY WARM->COLD " ;

If we now do a COLD start this will be lost, but if we first key in WARM->COLD and
then do a COLD start, it will still be there.
