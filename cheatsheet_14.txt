FUEL

Decrements the amount of fuel left.

SR

Checks to see if a character boundary is crossed (see SH8) and if so executes NBR.

SL

As SR but checks when movement is left.

SH4

Checks to see if phase is crossing a half character boundary, scrolling can only
increase from one pixel to four pixel movements on such a boundary or scrolling
will go out of phase.

SF

Accelerates horizontal speed (deccelerates if negative) by the amount on the
stack.

SS

Puts the current horizontal speed on the stack.

POLL

Checks to see if there's any Fuel left (a non zero value of FU will act as a true
flag) then first checks SPACE to accelerate right if not travelling too fast then
check CAPS SHIFT to accelerate left if not travelling too fast.  If a key is
pressed fuel is decremented.

-P

Updates phase and does a POLL when moving right.

+P

Updates phase and does a POLL when moving left.

SR1

Moves landscape 1 pixel right and adjusts pointers.

SR4

Moves landscape 4 pixels right and adjusts pointers provided a half character
boundary has been reached.  If not, a further 1 pixel movement must be made.

SL4

As SR4 when moving left.

SO

When speed is less than 7, keyboard is polled but no scrolling of the screen is
executed.  The lander is treated as horizontally stationary.
