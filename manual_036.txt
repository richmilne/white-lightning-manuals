tsfxx is a word which tests the stack for out or mounds.


A 2 - this indicates that either the dictionary has grown up to meet the stack (dictionary full) or that the stack has grown down to meet the dictionary.

Try:    :'It>r2 1000 0 00 ?STACK 0 0 0 0 0 IDOP ;<CR> TEST2 <CR>


Y 4 - this means that you have redefined an existing word using a new colon definition

Try:    : ROT ." NEW OEF'II7ITION " ; <Q2>

This is not really an error since the new word is still valid, but the old definition cannot be accessed unless you FORGET the new one.


1 6 - this error my occur when editing, loading or listing screens of data.

Try:    25 LIST <Q2>
This will produce MSGA6 and means you have tried to access a non-existent screenful of memory.


Y 9 - this indicates that an attempt was made to clear sprite space of less than 2 bytes.


A 10 - this indicates that one of the IDEAL words made reference to a sprite which did not exist, or that an attempt uss mode to insert a sprite using ISPRITE with a number previously allocated to an existing sprite.


W 17 - this will occur if you try to use a word in the 'immediate' mode which should only be used during compilation, i.e. during colon definitions. For a list of such words, refer to the glossary (words with "C" in the top right hand corner of the description).

Try:    DO <CR> IF «R>


A 18 - this occurs if a word meant for execution only, is put within a colon definition (~rds with "H" in the top right hand corner of the -description).


# 19 - this :mans that a colon definition contains conditionals that have not been paired.

e.g.    a LOOP without a 00
an FNDIF without an IF

Try:    : TEST3 ELSE ." td20IS', " ; <CR>
# 20 - this occurs if a colon definition has not been properly finished. Try:    : TEST4 IF ." OK ^ ; <CR>
