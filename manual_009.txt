4.  The K key transfers a character from the SPRITE SCREEN to the CHR$ SQR.

5.  The J key transfers a character from the CHR$ SQR to the SPRITE SCREEN.

6.  The S key defines and subsequently calls up a particular SPRITE.

7.  The G key GETs your sprite into memory.

8.  The P key PUTs your sprite from memory onto the SPRITE SCREEN.

9.  The D key enables you to enter a character by DIRECT DATA to the SPRITE
SCREEN.

You've used quite a few functions!  Have a go at calling up some more Arcade
Characters, change them if you wish, then GET them into memory and PUT them onto
the SPRITE SCREEN.

This is a most useful facility which can be of great service to you.  Most of the
information is fairly obvious, but we'll run through it all:

1.  MEMORY LEFT, as it says, is the amount of memory available for sprites; these
are the sprites that you define and do not include the Arcade Characters - to use
these, of course, you must define them as sprites by GETting them into memory.

2.  X POS Y POS, these are the current positions of your SPRITE SCREEN X and Y
cursors with reference to the figures on top and to the left of the SPRITE SCREEN.

3.  SPRITE, this indicates the position, in memory, where your defined sprite is.

4.  SPST, indicates the SPrite space STart point, in memory.  (Before any sprites
are defined this has an initial value of 65280).

5.  SPND, indicates the SPrite space eND point, in memory.

6.  SPRITE HEIGHT, indicates the height of your defined sprite, in character
squares, as indicated by the figures at the top and to the left of the SPRITE
SCREEN.  (This has an initial value of 1).

7.  SPRITE LENGTH, indicates the length of your defined sprite, in character
squares, as indicated by the figures at the top and to the left of the SPRITE
SCREEN.  (This has an initial value of 1).

8.  SPRITE NUMBER, indicates the sprite currently defined.  (This has an initial
value of 1).
