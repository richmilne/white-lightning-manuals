**MOD**     :  This will leave the remainder of N2/N1 on the top of the stack with
           the same sign as N2

e.g.    17 3 MOD . <CR>
will print 2  (17/3 = 5 remainder 2)


**/MOD**    :  This will leave the remainder and the quotient on the stack of N2/N1
           such that the quotient becomes the top number on the stack and the
           remainder becomes the second.

e.g.    17 3 /MOD . CR . <CR>
will print 5 (quotient)
           2 (remainder)


**3. STACK OPERATORS**


**DUP**     :  This will duplicate the top number on the stack.

e.g.    719 DUP . . <CR>
will print  719 719


**DROP**    :  This will drop the number from the top of the stack.

e.g.    111 222 DROP . <CR>
will print  111


**SWAP**    :  This will swap the top two numbers on the stack.

e.g.    111 222 SWAP . . <CR>
will print  111 222


**OVER**    :  This will copy the second number on the stack, making it a new number
           at the top of the stack without destroying the other numbers.

e.g.    111 222 OVER . CR . CR . <CR>
will print  111
            222
            111

since the stack before OVER was:

            222      TOS
            111

and after OVER is:

            111      TOS
     copy   222
            111


**ROT**     :  This will rotate the top three numbers on the stack, bringing the
           third number to the top of the stack.
