Command                Action

COPYM        Copy first sprite pixel data into second sprite
COPORM       OR first sprite pixel data into second sprite
COPXRM       XOR first sprite pixel data into second sprite
COPNDM       AND first sprite pixel data into second sprite
COPATTM      Copy first sprite attribute data into second sprite

Note:
If the dimensions of the two sprites are not identical, then the command will not
execute.

Example:

To make a complete copy of sprite 10 into sprite 8, use the following:

8 SP1 ! 10 SP2 ! COPYM COPATTM


SPRITE TRANSFORMATIONS

To increase the utility of the package, four extra words have been added to
invert, spin, reflect and enlarge sprites.  The inversion and reflection routines
work for screen and sprite data but the rotation and enlargement commands work
only on sprites and a dummy sprite is required to rotate or enlarge into.


Inversions

The sprite is "1's complemented"; in other words, all the pixels which are set
"on", became set "off" and vice-versa.  The attributes, however, remain
unchanged.

SPN          The number of the sprite to be inverted

ROW          Row of the top edge of the window (0 to 23)
LEN          Width of the screen window (1 to 32)
HGT          Height of the screen window (1 to 24)
