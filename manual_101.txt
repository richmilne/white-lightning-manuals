C,                   b ---                                                         

Store 8 bits of b into the next available dictionary byte, advancing the dictionary pointer.  This is only available on byte addressing computers, and should be used with caution on byte addressing mini- computers. 


C@                addr --- b                                                       

Leave the 8 bit contents of memory address.  On word addressing computers, further specification is needed regarding byte addressing. 


CFA                pfa --- cfa                                                     

Convert the parameter field address of a definition to its code field address. 


CMOVE    from to count ---                                                         

Move the specified quantity of bytes beginning at address from to address to.  The contents of address from is moved first proceeding toward high memory.  Further specification is necessary on word addressing computers. 


COLD                                                                               

The cold start proceedure to adjust the dictionary pointer to the minimum standard and restart via ABORT.  May be called from the terminal to remove application programs and restart. 


COMPILE                                                                          C2

When the word containing COMPILE executes, the execution address of the word following COMPILE is copied (compiled) into the dictionary.  This allows specific compilation situations to be handled in addition to simply compiling an execution address (which the interpreter already does). 


CONSTANT             n ---                                                       L0

A defining word used in the form:
                   n CONSTANT cccc
to create word cccc, with its parameter field containing n.  When cccc is later executed, it will push the value of n to the stack. 


CONTEXT                --- addr                                                U,L0

A user variable containing a pointer to the vocabulary within which dictionary searches will first begin.
