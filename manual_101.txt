C,                   b ---

Store 8 bits of b into the next available dictionary byte, advancing the
dictionary pointer.


C@                addr --- b

Leave the 8 bit contents of memory address.


CASE                   --- n (compiling)

Occurs in a colon definition in the form:
            CASE
            n OP ..... ENDOF
            .....
            ENDCASE
At run-time, CASE marks the start of a sequence of OF ... ENDOF statements.

At compile time CASE leaves n for compiler error checking.


CFA                pfa --- cfa

Convert the parameter field address of a definition to its code field address.


CMOVE    from to count ---

Move the specified quantity of bytes beginning at address 'from' to address 'to'.
The contents of address 'from' are moved first proceeding toward high memory.


COLD

The cold start procedure to adjust the dictionary pointer to the minimum standard
and restart via ABORT.  May be called from the terminal to remove application
programs and restart.


COMPILE                                                   C2

When the word containing COMPILE executes, the execution address of the word
following COMPILE is copied (compiled) into the dictionary.  This allows specific
compilation situations to be handled in addition to simply compiling an execution
address (which the interpreter already does).


CONSTANT             n ---                                L0

A defining word used in the form:
              n  CONSTANT  cccc
to create word cccc, with its parameter field containing n.  When cccc is later
executed, it will push the value of n to the stack.


CONTEXT                --- addr                         U,L0

A user variable containing a pointer to the vocabulary within which dictionary
searches will first begin.
