LAND

This word controls the landing sequence.  The landed sprite is placed on the pad
and sits until ENTER is pressed.  The explosion is then produced beneath the
lander to simulate take off and the landed lander is then exclusively OR'ed off of
the pad.

PTST

General purpose word which sets ROW, COL and SPN from the stack and then performs
a PUTBLS.

BARST

Adds the finishing touches to the gauges by putting sprites 28,31,32 and 33 in the
appropriate positions.  Uses PTST.

LETR

Places the gauge titles above the gauges.

HRSC

Puts the horizontal scale on the screen.

MARK

Draws the indicators used in the gauges.

PANEL

Execution word to set up the whole right hand side of the screen ie. all previous
words.

MAKE

See 'Creating Large Sprites'.

S1

Used to calculate the next column in the large landscape sprite, to be put to the
screen.  LEN is set back to 16 for the next operation.

NBR

Gets the appropriate column (calculated by S1) when the landscape is moving
right.

NBL

Gets the appropriate column when the landscape is moving left.

OPEN

Builds up the initial picture for the left of the screen.  Notice the use of EXX
to set up background variables for execution under interrupt.

SH8

PH describes the phase of the landscape with pixel resolution.  SH8 checks to see
if this phase is a multiple of 8 and if so sets a flag to indicate that a fresh
column should be GOT from the landscape sprite.  PH is also left on the stack.
