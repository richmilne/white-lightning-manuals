**TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE**

While OCRing and proofreading the scans of the White Lightning manuals, I have
tried to preserve, as best as I was able, the original pagination, layout,
spacing and formatting of the originals - while still incorporating all errata
noted and published in previous versions, and with a few (small) edits and
corrections of my own.

This transcription is still a work in progress. If you discover any further
mistakes, please create a pull request (or otherwise report the errors) against
the manuals' source repository at:
