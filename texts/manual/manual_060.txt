**Reflections**

There are four commands in this group for reflecting screen and memory, pixel and
attribute data.  A sprite is often required to point in two directions and the
command can either be used at the development stage or, if space is short, at
run-time.  The command causes horizontal reflection but vertical reflection is
possible, by combining rotations and reflections.


Parameter            Use

SPN          Number of sprite to be reflected (1 to 255)

Command             Action

**MIRM**         Reflect sprite pixel data about its centre
**MARM**         Reflect sprite attribute data about its centre


Parameter            Use

COL          Column of left hand edge of screen window (0 to 31)
ROW          Row of top edge of the window (0 to 23)
LEN          Width of screen window (1 to 32)
HGT          Height of screen window (1 to 24)


Command            Action
**MIRV**         Reflect screen pixel data about window centre
**MARV**         Reflect screen attribute data about window centre


**Spin**

This command involves an operation between two sprites with transposed dimensions.
If, for example, a sprite with dimensions 8 by 3 is to be spun into a second
sprite, this second sprite must have dimensions 3 by 8.  Square sprites are, of
course, no problem.  Pixel and attribute data are both rotated.  If the command is
to be used, it is important to remember that a second sprite will be needed to be
rotated into and that it is necessary to set this up in advance.  Rotation is 90
degrees clockwise.


Parameter             Use

SP2         Number of sprite to be rotated
SP1         Number of sprite to be rotated into


Command             Action

**SPINM**       Rotate 90 degrees clockwise sprite SP2 into sprite SP1.


Note:

A sprite cannot be rotated into itself, i.e. if SP1 and SP2 are the same number,
the rotation will not work.  The result is, however, well worth seeing!  Data is
"OR"ed from SP2 into SP1 so it is usually necessary to execute a CLSM to clear
sprite SP1 before execution.
