?STACK is a word which tests the stack for out of bounds.


 # 2  -  this indicates that either the dictionary has grown up to meet the
         stack (dictionary full) or that the stack has grown down to meet
         the dictionary.

Try:    : TEST2  1000  0  DO  ?STACK  0 0 0 0 0 LOOP  ; <CR>
          TEST2 <CR>


 # 4  -  this means that you have redefined an existing word using a new colon
         definition

Try:    : ROT ." NEW DEFINITION " ; <CR>

This is not really an error since the new word is still valid, but the old
definition cannot be accessed unless you FORGET the new one.


 # 6  -  this error my occur when editing, loading or listing screens of data.

Try:    25 LIST <CR>
This will produce MSG#6 and means you have tried to access a non-existent
screenful of memory.


 # 9  -  this indicates that an attempt was made to clear sprite space of
         less than 2 bytes.


 # 10 -  this indicates that one of the IDEAL words made reference to a sprite
         which did not exist, or that an attempt was mode to insert a sprite
         using ISPRITE with a number previously allocated to an existing sprite.


 # 17 -  this will occur if you try to use a word in the 'immediate' mode which
         should only be used during compilation, i.e. during colon definitions.
         For a list of such words, refer to the glossary (words with "C" in the
         top right hand corner of the description).

Try:    DO <CR>
        IF <CR>


 # 18 -  this occurs if a word meant for execution only, is put within a colon
         definition (words with "E" in the top right hand corner of the
         description).


 # 19 -  this means that a colon definition contains conditionals that have
         not been paired.

e.g.    a LOOP without a DO
        an ENDIF without an IF

Try:    : TEST3  ELSE  ." WRONG " ; <CR>

 # 20 -  this occurs if a colon definition has not been properly finished.

Try:    : TEST4 IF ." OK " ; <CR>
