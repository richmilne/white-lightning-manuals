To save BASIC source, type PROG <CR> to enter BASIC if you're not already there,
then just type SAVE "filename" as normal and re-enter White Lightning with PRINT
USR 24836.  Likewise, source can be reloaded by entering BASIC with a PROG, using
LOAD "filename" and then re-entering Forth with a PRINT USR 24836.


**Sprites**

Sprites can be saved from White Lightning and then re-Loaded into White Lightning,
but sprites saved by White Lightning, cannot be loaded into the sprite development
software which requires the additional array information preceding sprites  which
is not SAVEd by White Lightning.  Sprite development should always be done using
the development software, but if you do wish to save the sprites for later merging
then do the following:

1.  Find the start of sprites by typing SPST @ U.

2.  Find the length to save by typing SPND @ SPST @ - 1+ U.

3.  Note the start and length, then return to BASIC using PROG.

4.  Save using SAVE "filename" CODE start, length.

5.  Re-enter White Lightning using PRINT USR 24836.


**Merging Sprites**

Two blocks of sprites can be merged together in the main program using the
following procedure:

1.  Make a note of the SPST and SPND values of the second block to be
    merged. These are displayed by the sprite development software.

2.  Load the main White Lightning package and then load the first block
    of sprites in response to the "LOAD SPRITES Y/N" prompt.

3.  Load source as required and once in the main program relocate
    the first block of sprites downwards by the size of the second
    block.  Suppose the decimal values for SPST and SPND of the second
    block were 60000 and 65280 respectively, then type:

    DECIMAL 60000 65280 - SPST @ + U. <CR>

    (The DECIMAL is not required if you are already in DECIMAL mode).
    This will calculate the new start after relocation.  It is well worth
    checking that this will not run over your source code, so here is a
    quick calculation that will tell you if you have enough space.
    You need to know the highest screen number that you intend to use, for
    example screen 18.  Type:

    18 512 * 49664 + U. <CR>

    This will print the first free byte after screen 18.  So long as
    this result is lower than the new sprite start after relocation you
    can proceed.  Again, using the previous example where the block to be
    merged has SPST and SPND of 60000 and 65280 respectively, the line
    to type is:

    DECIMAL 60000 65280 - MLEN ! RELOCATE <CR>
