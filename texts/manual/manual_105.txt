**ENCLOSE**        addr1 c --- addr1 n1 n2 n3

The text scanning primitive used by WORD.  From the text address addr1 and an
ASCII delimiting character c, is determined the byte offset to the first
non-delimiter character n1, the offset to the first delimiter after the text n2,
and the offset to the first character not included.  This procedure will not
process past an ASCII 'null', treating it as an unconditional delimiter.


**END**                                                  P,C2,L0

This is an 'alias' or duplicate definition for UNTIL.


**ENDCASE**         addr n --- (compile)

Occurs in a colon definition in the form:
          CASE
          n OF ..... ENDOF
          .....
          ENDCASE
At run-time ENDCASE marks the conclusion of a CASE statement.

At compile time ENDCASE computes forward branch offsets.


**ENDIF**           addr n --- (compile)                 P,C0,L0

At run-time, ENDIF serves only as the destination of a forward branch from IF or
ELSE.  It marks the conclusion of the conditional structure.  THEN is another name
for ENDIF.  Both names are supported in Fig-FORTH.  See also IF and ELSE.

At compile time, ENDIF computes the forward branch offset from addr to HERE and
stores it at addr.  n is used for error tests.


**ENDOF**           addr n --- (compile)

Used as ENDIF but in CASE statements.


**ERASE**           addr n ---

Clear a region of memory to zero from addr over n addresses.


**ERROR**             line --- in blk

Execute error notification and restart of system.  WARNING is first examined.  If
1, the text of line n, relative to screen 4 of drive 0 is printed.  This line
number may be positive or negative, and beyond just screen 4.  If WARNING=0, n is
just printed as a message number (non disc installation).  If warning is -l, the
definition ABORT is executed, which executes the system ABORT.  The user may
cautiously modify this by altering (ABORT).  Fig-FORTH saves the contents of IN
and BLK to assist in determining the location of the error.  Final action is
execution of QUIT.
