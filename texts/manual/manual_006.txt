**OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS**

Insert the Sprite Generator Program Tape, type LOAD"" and load into the computer
as normal.

Once loaded, the program will auto-run and the screen message "COLD OR WARM
START" will appear.  If this is the first execution of the program or if you wish
to clear the sprite memory, press C for a COLD START.

A further screen message will now appear asking if you wish to change the buffer
size - this has a default value of 256 bytes.  For now, press N.  This function
will become more apparent later.

**NOTES:**

1. A WARM START will not destroy any sprites already in memory and if ever the
program is accidentally caused to BREAK, type GOTO 3 and in response to the screen
prompt, execute a WARM START.

2. A COLD START will destroy any and all sprites defined in memory.

3. WARM STARTs can only be executed after an initial COLD START.


**GETTING FAMILIAR WITH THE FUNCTION KEYS**

Now let's get familiar with some of the Function Keys - a full list will be found
at the end of this section.


**THE CHR$ SQR**

This is the grid square on which you create and edit characters for your own
sprite library.  To move the cursor:

1.  Press the 5 key for each movement to the left.

2.  Press the 6 key for each movement downward.

3.  Press the 7 key for each movement upward.

4.  Press the 8 key for each movement to the right.

Now that you know how to move the cursor, let's fill in a few squares:

1.  Move the cursor to any square that you like and release the keys.

2.  Press the 9 key to set the square.

3.  Now move the direction keys and fill in a few more squares.

Now that we have set some squares, what about deleting a few of then?  This is
simple:

1.  Move the cursor to a square that you have set and release the keys.

2.  Press the 0 key to clear the square.

Now have a go at setting and clearing some squares, just to get used to it.
