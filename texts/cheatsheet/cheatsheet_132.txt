**ADDITIONAL ERRATA**

While OCRing and proofreading the scans of the White Lightning manuals, I have
tried to preserve, as best as I was able, the original pagination, layout,
spacing and formatting of the originals. That includes all the spelling mistakes
and typos that I saw, which I have listed below.

__Cheatsheet__
