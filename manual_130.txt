Example 5

Often it is useful to define a word which carries out an operation that is
used frequently and which saves typing; for instance:
: DEM5 COL ! ROW ! SPN ! PUTBLS ;

If we wanted to carry out the simple PUT command in example 4, all we'd
need to type would be:
34 5 6 DEM5


Example 6

To scroll sprite 29 in memory by 1 pixel to the right with wrap and PUT it
on the screen at row 10, column 11, use:
: DEM6 29 SPN ! 10 ROW ! 11 COL ! WRR1M PUTBLS ;

To run DEM6 in background use:
' DEM6 INT-ON


Example 7

To fill a screen window, at column 17, row 5, 5 characters long and 10
characters high, with the attributes - 6 INK, 2 PAPER, 1 FLASH - use the
following:
: DEM7 1 FLASH 6 INK 2 PAPER 10 HGT ! 5 LEN ! 13 ROW ! 17 COL ! SETAV 0 FLASH 7 INK 1 PAPER ;


Example 8

To change the green face of sprite 28 into a red one use:
: DEM8 28 SPN ! 2 INK ! 1 BRIGHT 0 PAPER SETAM PUTBLS ;


Example 9

To pick a random number between 0 and 100 use:
: DEM9 100 RND . ;


Example 10

To pick a random INK colour and change sprite 34's INK colour to this 
colour, and then put it at column 10, row 10, use:
: DEM10 7 RND INK 34 SPN ! SETAM 10 ROW ! 10 COL ! PUTBLS ;

To run DEM10 in background use:
' DEM10 INT-ON
and to halt DEM10 use:
INT-OFF
