2. Press R(ROTATE) and enter the new sprite number, 16.
3. Press P(PVP) and press 1 - this has produced the final orientation.

Now let's look at attribute handling in more detail - clear the sprite screen and

1. Press X(IHI() and set to 3 (magenta).
2. Press C(PAPER) and set to 2 (red).
3. Press V(PLASH) and set to 1(ON).

11. Press Z (Arcade Character) and then enter 149.

12. Press L(IUgth) and enter 2, then press H (Height) and enter 2. 13. Press S (Sprite Number) and enter 18. 14. Press G (GET).

15. Press SPACE key (Place small sprite into large sprite) -enter small sprite an 18, larger sprite as 17, Row as 1, Column as 1 and HIS (1), as you get each prompt.

16. Move the X cursor by +2.

17. Press P(Pllf), answer the prompt with Y and then press 1- there you have it, your Robot inside the square.

Press L (Length) and enter 2, then press H(Height) and enter 2. 4. Press S(Sprite Nunber) and enter 19. 5. Press G (GET).
