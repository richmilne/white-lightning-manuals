7.  Press Z (Arcade Character) and enter 151 (a Robot).

8.  Set HEIGHT (H) to 2 and LENGTH (L) to 2.

9.  Set the Sprite Number (S) to 13, then press G to GET the character as a 
sprite.

10. Move the X cursor by +2.

11. Press R (ROTATE), and enter the new sprite number, 14.

12. Press P (PUT) and press 1 - a Robot rotated by 90 degrees!

Now that we have sprite 14 as a 90 degree rotation of sprite 13, why not go a 
little further ? Try this:


1.  Move the X cursor by +2.

2.  Press R (ROTATE) and enter the new sprite number, 15.

3.  Press P (PUT) and press 1 - this new robot has been rotated by 180 degrees 
from it's original orientation.

To produce the final (270 degree) orientation:

1.  Move the X cursor by +2.

2.  Press R (ROTATE) and enter the new sprite number, 16.

3.  Press P (PUT) and press 1 - this has produced the final orientation.


Now let's look at attribute handling in more detail - clear the sprite screen and 
position the X and Y cursors to X POS 1 Y POS 1.  The following two examples will 
show how to download and pick-up attributes between the attribute variables and 
the sprite screen:

1.  Press X (INK) and set to 3 (magenta).

2.  Press C (PAPER) and set to 2 (red).

3.  Press V (FLASH) and set to 1 (ON).

4.  Press B (BRIGHT) and set to 0 (OFF).

5.  Press A (ATTR) and set to 0.

6.  Press I (ATTRIBUTE DUMP) - the attributes will appear on the sprite screen.

7.  Now set all the attributes, X, C, V, B, and A to 0.

8.  Press U (PICK UP ATTRIBUTES) and the attributes on the screen will be loaded 
into the attribute variables.
