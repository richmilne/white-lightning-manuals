14. Move the X cursor by +2.

15. Press P (PUT) and respond with 1 - the characters have been "ORed" (merged).


Let's take this a little further and OR with the screen:

1.  Clear the sprite screen and position the cursors to X POS 1 Y POS 1.

2.  Press X (INK) and set to 1 (blue).

3.  Press C (PAPER) and set to 7 (white).

4.  Press V (FLASH) and set to 0.

5.  Press B (BRIGHT) and set to 1.

6.  Press A (ATTR) and set to 1.

7.  Press Z (Arcade Character) and enter 141 (Explosion) - you probably think
we're going to blow up the Robot!

8.  Press L (Length) and enter 2, then press H (Height) and enter 2.

9.  Press S (Sprite Number) and enter 22, then G (GET) sprite 22.

10. Move the X cursor by +2.

11. Press Z (Arcade Character) and enter 149 (Robot).

12. Press P (PUT) and enter 2 - sprite number 22 has been "ORed" with whatever was
on the screen.

13. Move the X cursor by +2.

14. Press P (PUT) and enter 1 - the explosion was unaffected!


Now let's take a look at a second logical operation - the AND function:

1.  Clear the sprite screen and position the cursors to X POS 1 Y POS 1.

2.  Press P (PUT) and enter 4, sprite 22 has been "ANDed" with the screen - as the
screen was empty, nothing happened.

3.  Press P (PUT) and enter 1 - the sprite is still there!


Now, lastly, let's look at the XOR function:

1.  Clear the sprite screen and move the cursors to X POS 1 Y POS 1.

2.  Press Z (Arcade Character) and enter 151 (Robot).

3.  Press P (PUT) and enter 3 - the Robot has blown up! (At last I here you say
!).
