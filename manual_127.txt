THE THREE VEHICLE SCROLLING DEMO

This demonstrates the 3 precisions of scrolls available - 1, 4 and 8 pixels.

Sprite 1, the vintage car, demonstrates the fine 1 pixel scroll using SCL1V.

Sprite 2, the van, demnstrates the faster 4 pixel scroll using SCL4V.

Sprite 3, the dragster, demonstrates, the very fast 8 pixel, or 1 character
scroll, using SCL8V.


THE TELEVISION

The television, sprite 13, is placed on the screen, a window is defined inside the
screen.

Sprite 5, the dancer is used to demonstrate the 1 pixel scroll with wrap, WRR1V.

Sprite 4, the duck, is used to demonstrate the 4 pixel scrool with wrap, WRR4V.

Sprite 6, the rocket, is used to demonstrate the 8 pixel scroll with wrap, WRR8V.


THE THREE SPACESHIPS

In this demonstration the 3 spaceships, sprite 15, are placed on the screen along
with their shadows, sprite 16.

They are scrolled to the right by 1 pixel, with alternate 1 pixel up and down
scrolls, to give a sense of motion.

The attributes of the forground, sprite 17, and the background, sprite 11, are
scrolled to the left.  The background being scrolled at one character per
execution with the foreground being scrolled two characters per execution to give
a sense of perspective.


THE BOUNCING MAN WITH HAT

The bouncing man is animated using sprites 28 and 29.  The sprites are placed on
the screen using PUTXRS, and removed again using PUTXRS, such that the character
appears to move behind the 'WHITE LIGHTNING' text without destroying it.

Simple DO LOOPS control his path.

Disabling interrupts, using DI, during the animation appeared to reduce the slight
flicker of the character, the interrupts where enabled again using EI.


THE CIRCLE OF ROTATING INVADERS

From the original invader, sprite 24, sprites 25, 26 and 27 were created using the
'ROTATE' facility of the sprite development package.

This demo shows how the centre invader, scrolling left by 1 pixel in background,
moves at a constant smooth rate, independent from that of the increasing and then
decreasing rate of the rotating invaders in the outer circle.
