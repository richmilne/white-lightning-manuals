**ADDITIONAL ERRATA**

Becuase the above errata were noted and published by Oasis, the corrections have
been incorporated into this version. However, while OCRing and proofreading the
scans of the original manual, I also noted the following typos, which (with the
exception of the one on p75) have NOT been corrected.
