#                    d1 --- d2                            LO
Generate from a double number d1, the next ASCII character which is placed
in an output string. Result d2 is the quotient after division by BASE, and
is maintained for further processing. Used between <# and #>. See #S.

#>                    d --- addr count                    LO
Terminates numeric output conversion by dropping d, leaving the text
address and character count suitable for TYPE.

#BUF                    --- n
A constant returning the number of disk buffers allocated.

#S                   d1 --- d2                            LO
Generates ASCII text in the output buffer, by the use of #, until a zero
double number results. Used between <# and #>.

'                       --- addr                        P,LO
Used in the form ' nnnn
Leaves the parameter field address of dictionary word nnnn. As a compiler
directive, executes in colon definition to compile the address as a
literal. If the word is not found after a search of CONTEXT and CURRENT,
an appropriate error message is given. Pronounced "tick".

P,M
~ ~. d in the form: (occc)
~:ore acomment that will be delimited by a right parenthesis on the same line. ~L'' occur during execution or in a colon-definition. A blank after the leading 1-:.•=nthesis is required.
C+
run-time procedure, compiled by •" which transmits the following in-line text the selected output device. See ,^
ODE)    C
N^-time procedure, compiled by ;CODE, that re-writes the code field of the
'[ recently defined word to point to the following machine code sequence. See iDE.
LOOP)    n --    C2
r<+n-time procedure compiled by +Ippp, which increments the loop index by n and ts for loop completion. See +IppP•
