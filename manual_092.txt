#                   d1 --- d2                                                    L0

Generate from a double number d1, the next ascii character which is placed in an output string.  Result d2 is the quotient after division by BASE, and is maintained for further processing.  Used between <# and #>.  See #S. 


#>                   d --- addr count                                            L0

Terminates numeric output conversion by dropping d, leaving the text address and character count suitable for TYPE. 


#S                  d1 --- d2                                                    L0

Generates ascii text in the text output buffer, by the use of #, until a zero double number n2 results.  Used between <# and #>.

Used in the form: .  ' nnnn Leaves the parameter field address of dictionary word nnnn.  As a compiler directive, executes in a colon-definition to compile the address as a literal.  If the word is not found after a search of CONTEXT and CURRENT, an appropriate error message is given.  Pronounced "tick".

Used in the form: ( cccc) Ignore a comment that will be delimited by a right parenthesis on the same line.  May occur during execution or in a colon-definition.  A blank after the leading parenthesis is required.
