         Press 1 to set switch ON.
         Press 0 to set switch OFF.

**B**        Activates the BRIGHT variable.

         above the key.

**D**        Activates DIRECT DATA INPUT
         Accepts 8 bytes of data, one byte at a time, followed by ENTER, via
         the keyboard, to the position on the sprite Screen indicated by
         the cursors.  Inputted data must be in the range 0 to 255 Decimal
         or, H00 to HFF HEX (the character H must precede Hex entry).

         NOTE:  If Attribute switch = 1, then the four current attributes will
         be used at the same position as well.

**E**        Activates the SCREEN FUNCTIONS.
         You will be given three options: press 1, 2 or 3.

         1 INVERT
         Option 1, INVERT, sets all 0 bits to 1 and all 1 bits to 0,
         in a window whose length is held in the "Sprite length"
         variable and whose height is held in the "Sprite height"
         variable.  The inversion will take place from the positioning
         of the sprite screen cursors, i.e. at the intersection of an
         imaginary line drawn from each cursor.

         2 MIRROR
         Option 2 MIRROR, 'Flips' a window whose height is held in the
         "Sprite height" variable and whose length is held in the "Sprite
         length" variable.  The Mirroring will take place about the
         vertical centre of the screen window.

         3 MIRROR ATTRIBUTES
         Option 3 MIRROR ATTRIBUTES, 'Flips' the attributes in a window
         whose height is held in the "Sprite height" variable and whose
         length is held in the "Sprite length" variable.  The Mirroring of
         Attributes will take place about the vertical centre of the screen
         window

**F**        Activates FLASH WINDOW.
         Flashes the current screen window whose height is held in the
         SPRITE HEIGHT variable and whose length is held in the SPRITE LENGTH
         variable.  The Flash will take place at the position of the sprite
         screen cursors.

         Flash is used to check the position of the sprite screen cursors,
         to check that the height and length parameters are as required or
         to check that the window is correctly positioned.
