**TASK**

A no-operation word which can mark the boundary between applications.  By
forgetting TASK and re-compiling, an application can be discarded in its entirety.


**TEXT**                 c ---

Accept the following test to PAD.  c is the text delimiter.

**THEN**                                                 P,C0,L0

An alias for ENDIF.


**TIB**                    --- addr                            U

A user variable containing the address of the terminal input buffer.


**TOGGLE**          addr b ---

Complement the contents of addr by the bit pattern b.


**TRAVERSE**       addr1 n --- addr2

Move across the name field of a Fig-FORTH variable length name field.  addr1 is
the address of either the length byte or the last letter.  If n=-1, the motion is
toward low memory.  The addr2 resulting is the address of the other end of the
name.


**TYPE**        addr count ---                                L0

Transmit count characters from addr to the selected output device.


**U<**               u1 u2 --- f

Leave the boolean value of any unsigned less-than comparison.  Leaves f=1 or u1 >
u2; otherwise leaves 0.  This function should be used when comparing memory
addresses.


**U***               u1 u2 --- ud

Leave the unsigned double number product of two unsigned numbers.


**U.**                   u ---

Prints an unsigned 16 bit number converted according to BASE. A trailing blank
follows.
