TASK                                                                               

A no-operation word which can mark the boundary between applications.  By forgetting TASK and re-compiling, an application can be discarded in its entirety. 


THEN                                                                        P,CO,LO

An alias for ENDIF. 


TIB                    --- addr                                                   U

A user variable containing the address of the terminal input buffer. 


TOGGLE          addr b ---                                                         

Complement the contents of addr by the bit pattern b. 


TRAVERSE       addr1 n --- addr2                                                   

Move across the name field of a fig-FORTH variable length name field.  addr1 is the address of either the length byte or the last letter.  If n=1, the motion is toward hi memory; if n=-l, the motion is toward low memory.  The addr2 resulting is address of the other end of the name. 


TRIAD              scr ---                                                         

Display on the selected output device the three screens which include that numbered scr, beginning with a screen evenly divisible by three.  Output is suitable for source text records, and includes a reference line at the bottom taken from line 15 of screen4. 


TYPE        addr count ---                                                       L0

Transmit count characters from addr to the selected output device. 


U*               u1 u2 --- ud                                                      

Leave the unsigned double number product of two unsigned numbers.
