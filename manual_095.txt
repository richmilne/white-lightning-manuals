-FIND                  --- pfa b tf  (found)                                
                       --- ff        (not found)       

Accepts the next text word (delimited by blanks) in the input stream to HERE, then 
searches the CONTEXT and then CURRENT vocabularies for a matching entry.  If 
found, the dictionary entry's parameter field address, its length byte, and a 
boolean true is left.  Otherwise, only a boolean false is left. 


-TRAILING      addr n1 --- addr n2                                                 

Adjusts the character count n1 of a text string beginning address to suppress the 
output of trailing blanks.  i.e. the characters at addr+n1 to addr+n2 are blanks. 


.                    n ---                                                       L0

Print a number from a signed l6 bit two's complement value, converted according to 
the numeric BASE.  A trailing blanks follows.  Pronounced "dot". 


."                                                                             P,L0

Used in the form:  ." cccc " 

Compiles an in-line string cccc (delimited by the trailing "), with an execution 
procedure to transmit the text to the selected output device.  If executed outside 
a definition, ." will immediately print the text until the final ".  See (."). 


.LINE         line scr ---                                                         

Print on the terminal device, a line of text by its line and screen number.  
Trailing blanks are suppressed. 


.R               n1 n2 ---                                                         

Print the number n1 right aligned in a field whose width is n2.  No following 
blanks printed. 


/                n1 n2 --- quot                                                  L0

Leave the signed quotient of n1/n2. 


/MOD             n1 n2 --- rem quot                                              L0

Leave the remainder and signed quotient of n1/n2.  The remainder has the sign of 
the dividend. 


0 1 2 3                --- n                                                       

These small numbers are used so often, that it is attractive to define them by 
name in the dictionary as constants.
