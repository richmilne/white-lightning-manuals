XVEL

The horizontal velocity is represented by one of 3 scroll speeds but safe landings
can only be made if the pointer is in the "safe" region in the centre of the
gauge.

THE SMALL SCREEN

This gives a macroscopic view of the 8 screens.  The bases are marked.  The gauge
sometimes cannot keep up with the lander movement but at scroll speeds of a pixel
it will soon "catch up" with the real positions.  This is not a "feature" we must
admit, keeping up with the gauge slows the foreground program down a lot.
