    A)  SPRITE HEIGHT = 2
    B)  SPRITE LENGTH = 2
    C)  SPRITE NUMBER = 19
    D)  MEMORY LEFT   = The remaining memory for sprites.
    E)  SPRITE        = Start address of sprite being tested.


A function is provided to Wipe a sprite from memory and adjust pointers.  Leave 
everything as it is and try:

1.  Press W (Wipe sprite) - remember sprite 19 has already been defined.  Respond 
to the prompt with Y.

2.  Press T (Test sprite) and an error message will appear on the text line -
SPRITE NO LONGER EXISTS


While we are considering error messages, have a go at this:

1.  Press Z (Arcade Character) and then press 63.

2.  Press S (Sprite Number) and press 12 - an error message will appear, SPRITE 
ALREADY DEFINED.  Sprite number 12 is not corrupted in any way, nor is the one you
have put to the screen.  All that you need to do is choose a different sprite 
number which has not already been allocated.


There's one area we've been avoiding all the way through - the Logic Functions. 
We don't Want to wade into the depths of Boolean algebra here, but instead, 
provide a few examples which hopefully show the application of the XOR, OR and 
AND operations to tHis part of the package.  They are provided for advanced 
applications only and their results are summarised on the sprite generator panel. 
Let's see what they do:

1.  Clear the sprite screen and position the cursors to X POS 1 Y POS 1.

2.  Press X (INK) and set to 3 (magenta).

3.  Press C (PAPPR) and set to 0 (black).

4.  Press V (FLASH) and set to 0.

5.  Press B (BRIGHT) and set to 1.

6.  Press A (ATTR) and set to 1.

7.  Press Z (Arcade Character) and enter 149 (Robot).

8.  Press L (Length) and enter 2, then press H (Height) and enter 2.

9.  Press S (Sprite Number) and enter 21, then G (GET) to Get the sprite.

10. Move the X cursor by +2.

ll. Press P (PUT) and respond to the prompt with 1.

12. Press Z (Arcade Character) and enter 151 (Robot).

13. Press O (Logical Sprite Functions) and press 1.
