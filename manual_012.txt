9.  Move the sprite screen X cursor by +2.

10. Change the INK (X) to 4 (green).

ll. Press Z (Arcade Character) and enter 151 (another Robot).


OK, you should have two robots on the sprite screen - lets define them as a
combined sprite:

1.  Move the cursors to X POS 1 Y POS 1.

2.  Press L (Length Variable) and set to 4.

3.  Press H (Height Variable) and set to 2.

4.  Press S (Sprite Number) and enter 12.

5.  Press G (GET Function) and respond to the prompt with Y.


We have now set up a 4 by 2 sprite oontaining both characters. Now lets change
them over in memory:

1.  Press M (Sprite Memory Functions), respond to the prompt with Y, and press 2
(MIRROR) - nothing happens on the sprite screen - this is a memory function.

Let's prove that the sprite has been altered:

1.  Move the sprite screen Y cursor by +3.

2.  Press P (PUT) respond to the prompt with Y and press 1 - the sprite has been
reflected.


We can return the attributes to their former Robots quite easily:

1.  Press M (Sprite Memory Functions), respond to the prompt with Y, and press 3
(Mirror Attributes).

2.  Move the Y cursor by +3 and press P (PUT), respond to the prompt with Y and
press 1 - now the attributes have mirrored.


Let's move on a little further now.  We now look at a second sprite transformation
- rotation.  Try the following:

1.  Clear the sprite screen and set the X and Y cursors to X P0S 1 Y POS 1.

2.  Set INK (X) to 1 (blue).

3.  Set PAPER (C) to 7 (white).

4.  Set FLASH (V) to 0.

5.  Set BRIGHT (B) to 1.

6.  Set ATTR (A) to 1.
