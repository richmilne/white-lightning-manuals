SUMMARY OF MICRODRIVE WHITE LIGHTNING

1.  Only use specially prepared cartridges for EDITing and use them
    exclusively for storing screens.

2.  CLEAR a screen before using it for the first time and change the
    previous screen to skip over it if it is a bad sector.  Do not use
    this screen again.

3.  Microdrive commands such as ERASE, VERIFY etc. can be executed after
    entering BASIC using PROG.

4.  Do NOT break into the program (SHIFT and SPACE) while the microdrive
    is running.

5.  RESERVE no longer executes.

6.  There are some additional error messages (listed above).

7.  Always execute a FLUSH after editing of a screen is complete.



THE MICRODRIVE SPRITE GENERATOR


INTRODUCTION

The microdrive Sprite Generator Program is upwardly compatible with the current
tape based version and tape LOADing and SAVEing is still supported.  An extra
command has been added to make the creation of large sprites easier and the arcade
character set has been re-organised to give extra sprite space.


IMPLEMENTING ON MICRODRIVE

The first thing to do is to transfer the program onto a microdrive cartridge.

1.  Insert Tape 1 in your cassette and rewind to Side A.

2.  Type LOAD"":LOAD""CODE

3.  Place a formateed cartridge in microdrive 1.

4.  Type GOTO 9998.

This will save and verify the generator onto the microdrive.  Now type PRINT USR 0
to clear memory.

The microdrive version can now be LOADed and RUN by typing:

        LOAD *"M";1;"S"


SAVING AND LOADING SPRITES

The micrdorive version of the Sprite Development Program still allows sprites to
be loaded and saved from and to tape as described in the manual.

A separate cartridge is required to store sprites.  The program will allow you to
save five files of sprites per cartridge, these being numbered 1 to 5.
