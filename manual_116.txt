**VOCABULARY**                                               E,L

A defining word used in the form:
               VOCABULARY cccc
to create a vocabulary definition cccc.  Subsequent use of cccc will make it the
CONTEXT vocabulary which is searched first by INTERPRET.  The sequence "cccc
DEFINITIONS" will also make cccc the CURRENT vocabulary, into which, new
definitions are placed.

In Fig-FORTH, cccc will also be chained so as to include all definitions of the
vocabulary in which cccc is itself defined. All vocabularies ultimately chain to
Forth.  By convention, vocabulary names are to be declared IMMEDIATE.  See
VOC-LINK.


**VLIST**

List the names of the definitions in the context vocabulary.  Pressing "Break"
will terminate the listing.


**WARNING**                --- addr                            U

A user variable containing a value controlling messages.
If = 1 disc is present, and screen 4 of drive 0 is the base location for messages.
If = 0, no disc is present and messages will be presented by number.  If = -1,
execute (ABORT)  for a user specified procedure.  See MESSAGE, ERROR, ABORT.


**WHERE**            n1 n2 ---

If an error occurs during LOAD from disc, ERROR leaves these values on the stack
to show the user where the error occurred. WHERE uses these to print the screen
and line number of where this is.


**WHILE**                f --- (run-time)
              addr1 n1 --- addr1 n1 addr2 n2            P,C2

Occurs in a colon-definition in the form:
                  BEGIN ... WHILE (tp) ... REPEAT
At run-time, WHILE selects conditional execution based on boolean flag f.  If f is
true (non-zero), WHILE continues execution of the true part through to REPEAT,
which then branches back to BEGIN.  If f is false (zero), execution skips to just
after REPEAT, exiting the structure.

At compile time, WHILE emplaces (0BRANCH) and leaves addr2 of the reserved offset.
The stack values will be resolved by REPEAT.


**WIDTH**                  --- addr                            U

In Fig-FORTH, a user variable containing the maximum number of letters saved in
the compilation of a definitions name.  It must be 1 through to 31, having a
default value of 31.  The name character count and its natural characters are
saved, up to the value of WIDTH.  The value may be changed at any time within the
above limits.
