VOCABULARY                                                                      E,L

A defining word used in the form:
             VOCABULARY cccc
to create a vocabulary definition cccc.  Subsequent use of cccc will make it the CONTEXT vocabulary which is searched first by INTERPRET.  The sequence "cccc DEFINITIONS" will also make cccc the CURRENT vocabulary into which new definitions are placed. 
 
In fig-FORTH, cccc will be so chained as to include all definitions of the vocabulary in which cccc is itself defined.  All vocabularys ultimately chain to Forth.  By convention, vocabulary names are to be declared IMMEDIATE.  See VOC-LINK. 


VLIST                                                                              

List the names of the definitions in the context vocabulary.  "Break" will terminate the listing. 


WARNING                --- addr                                                   U

A user variable containing a value controlling messages.  If = 1 disc is present, and screen 4 of drive 0 is the base location for messages.  If = 0, no disc is present and messages will be presented by number.  If = -1, execute (ABORT) for a user specified procedure.  See MESSAGE, ERROR. 


WHILE                f --- (run-time)                                              
                ad1 nl --- ad1 n1 ad2 n2                                       P,C2

Occurs in a colon-definition in the form:
          BEGIN ...  WHILE (tp) ...  REPEAT
At run-time, WHILE selects conditional execution based on boolean flag f.  If f is true (non-zero), WHILE continues execution of the true part thru to REPEAT, which then branches back to BEGIN.  If f is false (zero), execution skips to just after REPEAT, exiting the structure. 
 
At compile time, WHILE emplaces (0BRANCH) and leaves ad2 of the reserved offset.  The stack values will be resolved by REPEAT. 


WIDTH                  --- addr                                                   U

In fig-FORTH, a user variable containing the maximum number of letters saved in the compilation of a definitions' name.  It must be 1 thru 31, with a default value of 31.  The name character count and its natural characters are saved, up to the value in WIDTH.  The value may be changed at any time within the above limits.
