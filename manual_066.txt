**FORTH/BASIC WORDS**

For those users who have mastered and grown used to the Spectrum's own graphics
commands, a set of 18 Forth implementations of Spectrum words is provided.
Parameters are placed on the stack in the same order as they occur in their BASIC
implementations.  If an error occurs during the execution of a BASIC word, Forth
should be re-entered via a WARM start, i.e. PRINT USR 24836.  For a full
description of the action of each of these words refer to your Spectrum manual.


**PARAMETERS**      **WORD**      **ACTION**

                **COPY**      The screen in 'dumped' to the ZX-Printer.

ROW, COL        **AT**        The print position is moved the specified
                          Column and Row.

COLOUR          **BORDER**    The border colour is set to one of the 8
                          Spectrum colours.

                **CLS**       The screen is cleared of pixel data and the
                          attributes set to the current INK, PAPER,
                          BRIGHT and FLASH values.

X,Y,ANGLE       **DRAW-ARC**  See Spectrum manual page 122.

X,Y,RADIUS      **CIRCLE**    See Spectrum manual page 123.

X,Y             **DRAW**      See Spectrum manual page 121.

X,Y             **PLOT**      See Spectrum manual page 121.

ROW, COL        **SCREEN$**   The character at the screen position defined
                          by the two values at the top of the stack is
                          tested to see if it is one of the Spectrum's
                          pre-defined characters.  The ASCII value
                          is left on the stack.

ROW, COL        **ATTR**      The code for the attribute at the screen
                          position defined by the top two values on the
                          stack is left on the stack.

X,Y             **POINT**     The pixel at the (x,y) co-ord defined by the
                          top two values on the stack is tested and
                          a true or false flag stacked depending on
                          whether the pixel is set or not.

COL             **TAB**       Set the horizontal print position to the
                          value at the top of the stack.

COLOUR          **INK**       Set the INK colour to the value at the top
                          of the stack.

COLOUR          **PAPER**     Set the PAPER colour to the value at the top
                          of the stack.

FLAG            **OVER.**     Note the full stop at the end of OVER.
                          This sets the printing mode according to
                          the value of FLAG which is zero or one.

FLAG            **INVERSE**   As for OVER.

FLAG            **BRIGHT**    As for OVER.
