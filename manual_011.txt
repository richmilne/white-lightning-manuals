1.  Press E (Screen Functions), answer Y and press 2 (Mirror) - the character is
reflected!

2.  Now press S (Sprite Number) and enter 11.

3.  Press G (GET) and then Y - again it flashes to confirm.


We now have two sprites, one facing left and one facing right.  Let's set some new
attributes.

1.  Press X (INK) and enter 4 (green).

2.  Press I to activate the Attribute Dump facility.

3.  Move the sprite screen X cursor 1 place to the right and press I again - the
top half is done!

4.  Move the sprite screen Y cursor 1 place down and press I.

5.  Finally, move the sprite screen cursor one place to the left and press I again
- there you have it, a red character to the left and a green one to the right.


If you want to swap the colours the other way around - yes you're right this can
be done:

1.  Position the sprite screen cursors to X POS 1 Y POS 1.

2.  We will have to set up the screen window for the exchange:

Press L (Length Variable) and enter 4 - the window will flash.

3.  Press E (Screen Functions), answer Y to the prompt and press 3 to MIRROR
ATIRIBUTES - watch the screen as you press 3, it happens very quickly!  The red
Dalek becomes green and the green Dalek becomes red.


Right then - we'll move on a little.  We'll oonsider some sprite operations.
These are operations which take place in memory on the stored sprites.  We'll
begin by setting up a new sprite comprising two arcade characters and then go on
to change their positions in the sprite in memory. Have a go at this:

1.  Clear the sprite screen (SYMBOL SHIFT Q).  Don't worry about your previous
characters - you'll probably remember that they are still in memory as sprites 10
and ll.

2.  Make sure that the sprite screen cursors are set to X POS 1 Y POS 1.

3.  Set INK (X) to 6 (yellow).

4.  Set PAPER (C) to 0.

5.  Set FLASH (V) to 0.

6.  Set BRIGHT (B) to 1.

7.  Set ATTR (A) to 1.

8.  Press Z (Arcade Character) and enter 149 (a Robot).
