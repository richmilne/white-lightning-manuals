Sprites 1 to 100 are produced using the sprite generator program.  Sprites 101 to 
107 are created in the main program using the word SET.  Sprite 128 is constructed 
from sprites 10 to 25 in the main program using the word MAKE.


The Lunar Lander

This listing is provided as an example of White Lightning programming.  In order 
to run the game you will need to enter the sprites as described in the next 
section.  This is a fairly laborious task so we can offer the fainthearted, 
sprites and demo on tape for one pound seventy five pence.  We recommend, however, 
that you take the time to build up the sprites yourself as an excercise in self 
discipline if nothing else!

The program executes one word in foreground and one word in background.  The 
program can be roughly sub-divided the following way:

Screens 6,7,8

These set up the screen display, dials etc.

Screens 9,10,11

These three screens form the routine which scrolls the landscape at one of three 
speeds.  This routine is executed in background to give smoother movement.

Screens 11,12,13,14,15,16,17

These control the flight of the lander, manipulate the dials, execute the crashes 
and so on.

Screen 18

This executes all the previous definitions in the right order to produce the final 
game.

Let's now look at the program in more detail.
