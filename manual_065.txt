ATTOFF       After the execution of ATOFF, group GETs and PUTs will move
             pixel data only.


CALL         Control jumps to a machine code subroutine whose address
             is held at the top of the stack.

Example:

HEX D000 CALL

would execute a machine code subroutine at location D000 HEX. Don't type this
unless you have a machine code routine at HEX D000!


 ZAP         Once program development is completed and you have compiled
             your final program into the dictionary, typing ZAP will
             producee a run-time version. The length of the final
             version is displayed to the screen aid a copy can be saved
             by typing:

                        SAVE "filename" CODE 24832, LENGTH

             the length being the length displayed.  Typing:

                        PRINT USR 24832

              will execute the last word defined before the ZAP command.
              This is the only form in which White Lightning programs
              can be commercially sold.


 ZAPINT       As above except that programs which utilise the
              Foreground/8ackground facility must be produced using the
              ZAPINT command as opposed to the ZAP command.  The only
              real difference is that the first five screens also need
              to be saved and that the top 16 bytes of RAM will be
              used by the final program.


 PRT-ON       All subsequent screen output is to ZX-Printer only.


 PRT-OFF      All subsequent output is to screen only.

Example:

PRT-0N VLIST PRT-OFF

will list the current FORTH dictionary to the ZX-Printer.
