A user variable that contains the initial value for the stack pointer.  Pronounced S-zero.  See SP!


SCR                    --- addr                                                   U

A user variable containing the screen number most recently reference by LIST. 


SIGN               n d --- d                                                     L0

Stores an ascii "-" sign just before a converted numeric output string in the text output buffer when n is negative.  n is discarded but double number d is maintained.  Must be used between <# and #>. 


SMUDGE                                                                             

Used during word definition to toggle the "smudge bit" in a definitions' name field.  This prevents an uncompleted definition from being found during dictionary searches, until compiling.  is completed without error. 


SP!                                                                                

A computer dependent proceedure to initialize the stack pointer from SO. 


SP@                    --- addr                                                    

A computer dependent proceedure to return the address of the stack position to the top of the stack, as it was before SP@ was executed. 
    (e.g.   1  2  SP@  @  .    .    .      would

    type 2  2   1)

Transmit an ascii blank to the output device. 


SPACES               n ---                                                       L0

Transmit n ascii blanks to the output device. 


STATE                  --- addr                                                L0,U

A user variable containing the compilation state.  A non-zero value indicates compilation.  The value itself may be implementation dependent. 


SWAP             nl n2 --- n2 n1                                                 L0

Exchange the top two values On the stack.
