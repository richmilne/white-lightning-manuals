S0                     --- addr                                                   U

A user variable that contains the initial value for the stack pointer.  Pronounced 
S-zero.  See SP!


SCR                    --- addr                                                   U

A user variable containing the screen number most recently reference by LIST. 


SIGN               n d --- d                                                     L0

Stores an ASCII "-"  sign just before a converted numeric output string in the 
text output buffer when n is negative.  n is discarded, but double number d is 
maintained.  Must be used between <# and #>. 


SMUDGE                                                                             

Used during word definition to toggle the "smudge bit" in a definition's name 
field.  This prevents an uncompleted definition from being found during dictionary 
searches, until compiling is completed without error. 


SP!                                                                                

A computer dependent procedure to initialize the stack pointer from S0. 


SP@                    --- addr                                                    

A computer dependent procedure to return the address of the stack position to the 
top of the stack, as it was before SP@ was executed. (e.g. 1 2 SP@ @ . . . would 
print 2 2 1).


SPACE            

Transmit an ASCII blank to the output device. 


SPACES               n ---                                                       L0

Transmit n ASCII blanks to the output device. 


STATE                  --- addr                                                L0,U

A user variable containing the compilation state.  A non-zero indicates 
compilation.  The value itself may be implementation dependent. 


SWAP             nl n2 --- n2 n1                                                 L0

Exchange the top two values On the stack.
