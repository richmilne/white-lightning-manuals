4. Finally, type NEW <CR> to restore the editing buffers to their
   microdrive addresses.


BAD SECTORS

Regrettably, at the time of writing, whilst the microdrive cartridge costs
about twice as much as a standard 5 1/4 inch floppy, the number of bad
sectors is still extremely high. Forth screens map directly to microdrive
sectors, so screen 25 uses sector 25 and so on. So as we shall see, some
screens may be unusable.

A bad sector will be identified by White Lightning the first time a read
or write operation is carried out, and error 8 is generated. Note that
executing CLEAR will mean that you can find bad sectors before editing
into them. If you do find a bad sector, keep a note of it and don't use
that screen. There is a simple way around this problem as we shall see in
the following example. Assume we want to edit into screens 25 to 28 and
that we did the following:

1. Type 25 CLEAR 0 EDIT .
2. Key in text for lines 0 to 6.
3. Type 7 EDIT then key in --> to indicate continue with next screen when
   LOADing.
4. Type 26 CLEAR 0 EDIT .
5. Key in text for lines 0 to 6.
6. Type 7 EDIT and key in --> .

Now suppose when we typed in 27 CLEAR that we got error 8, indicating
drive error. This would mean that sector 27 was a bad sector and therefore
that screen 27 was unusable.

Remember that in screen 26 the last line was:
	-->
which tells Forth to continue LOADing on the next screen. The next screen
is screen 27 which is unusable, so we have to change the last line of
screen 26 to become:
	7 28 LOAD
which tells Forth to continue LOADing at screen 28. This will then skip
over the bad sector.
