ABORT                                                                            L0

Clear the stacks and enter the execution state.  Return control to the operators terminal, printing a message appropriate to the installation. 


ABS                  n --- u                                                     L0

Leave the absolute value of n as u. 


AGAIN           addr n --- (compiling)                                      P,C2,L0

Used in a colon-definition in the form:
                 BEGIN ...  AGAIN
At run-time, AGAIN forces execution to return to corresponding BEGIN.  There is no effect on the stack.  Execution cannot leave this loop (unless R> DROP is executed one level below). 
 
At compile time, AGAIN compiles BRANCH with an offset from HERE to addr.  n is used for compile-time error checking. 


ALLOT                n ---                                                       L0

Add the signed number to the dictionary pointer DP.  May be used to reserve dictionary space or re-origin memory.  n is with regard to computer address type (byte or word). 


AND              n1 n2 --- n2                                                    L0

Leave the bitwise logical and of n1 and n2 as n3. 


B/BUF                  --- n                                                       

This constant leaves the number of bytes per disc buffer, the byte count read from disc by BLOCK. 


B/SCR                  --- n                                                       

This constant leaves the number of blocks per editing screen.  By convention, an editing screen is 1O24 bytes organized as 16 lines of 64 characters each. 


BACK              addr ---                                                         

Calculate the backward branch offset from HERE to addr and compile into the next available dictionary memory address. 


BASE                   --- addr                                                U,L0

A user variable containing the current number base used for input and output conversion.
