SCROLLING

SCREEN SCROLLS

The horizontal screen scrolls are by 1, 4 or 8 pixels, left or right and with or
without wrap.  The vertical scrolls are slightly more flexible.  The variable NPX
is loaded with the number of pixels to be scrolled, positive for upward movement
and negative for downward movement.  In each case, a screen window has to be
defined.


Horizontal Scrolls

Parameter                  Use

COL         Column of the left hand edge of the window (0-31)
ROW         Row of the top edge of the window (0-23)
LEN         Width of the window (1-32)
HGT         Height of the window (1-24)

Command                 Action

WRL1V       Scroll left  1 pixel  with wrap
WRR1V       Scroll right 1 pixel  with wrap
SCL1V       Scroll left  1 pixel,   no wrap
SCR1V       Scroll right 1 pixel,   no wrap
WRL4V       Scroll left  4 pixels with wrap
WRR4V       Scroll right 4 pixels with wrap
SCL4V       Scroll left  4 pixels,  no wrap
SCR4V       Scroll right 4 pixels,  no wrap
WRL8V       Scroll left  8 pixels with wrap
WRR8V       Scroll right 8 pixels with wrap

SCR8V       Scroll right 8 pixels,  no wrap

Note:

Before executing any of these commands, the window needs to be set up using the
four parameters above.  If the command does not execute, it is likely that part of
the window does not lie on the screen.  COL + LEN should be in the range 1 to 32
and LEN + HGT should be in the range 1 to 24.

Example:

To see these commands work, it is a good idea to do a VLIST first so that there is
some data on the screen.  The four parameters will need to be set, unless of
course they have previously been defined, but for this example let us assume that
they haven't.  To scroll a window at COL 4, ROW 5 with height 4 characters and
width 3 characters, with wrap, 4 pixels left, type the following:

4 COL ! 5 ROW ! 4 HGT ! 3 LEN ! WRL4V <CR>

If there is no data on the screen, type:

VLIST 4 COL ! 5 ROW ! 4 HGT ! 3 LEN ! WRL4V <CR>

A window column 4 Row 5 has been scrolled left 4 pixels - if you did'nt see it
happen type:
