This glossary contains all of the word definitions in Release 1 of
fig-FORTH. The definitions are presented in the order of their ascii sort.

The first line of each entry shows a symbolic description of the action of
the proceedure on the parameter stack. The symbols indicate the order in
which input parameters have been placed on the stack. Three dashes "---"
indicate the execution point; any parameters left on the stack are listed.
In this notation, the top of the stack is to the right.


The symbols include:

addr   memory address
b      8 bit byte (i.e. hi 8 bits zero)
c      7 bit ascii character (hi 9 bits zero)
d      32 bit signed double integer} most significant portion with sign
       on top of stack.
f      boolean flag. 0=false, non-zero=true
ff     boolean false flag=0
n      16 bit signed integer number
u      16 bit unsigned integer
tf     boolean true flag=non-zero

The capital letters on the right show definition characteristics:

C      May only be used within a colon definition. A digit indicates number
       of memory addresses used, if other than one.
E      Intended for execution only.
L0     Level Zero definition of FORTH-78
L1     Level One definition of FORTH-78
P      Has precedence bit set. Will execute even when compiling.
U      A user variable.


Unless otherwise noted, all references to numbers are for 16 bit signed
integers. On 8 bit data bus computers, the high byte of a number is on top
of the stack, with the sign in the leftmost bit. For 32 bit signed double
numbers, the most significant part (with the sign) is on top.

All arithmetic is implicitly 16 bit signed integer math, with error and
under-flow indication unspecified.

!               n addr ---                                                       L0

Store 16 bits of n at address.  Pronounced "store". 


!CSP                                                                               

Save the stack position in CSP.  Used as part of the compiler security.
