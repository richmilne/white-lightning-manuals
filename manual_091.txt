Fig-FORTH GLOSSARY


This glossary contains all of the word definitions in Release 1 of fig-FORTH.  The
definitions are presented in the order of their ASCII sort and are reproduced
courtesy of the FORTH INTEREST GROUP, P.O. BOX 1105, SAN CARLOS, CA 94070.

The first line of each entry shows a symbolic description of each action of the
procedure on the parameter stack.  The symbols indicate the order in which input
parameters have been placed on the stack.  Three dashes "---" indicate the
execution point; any parameters left on the stack are listed. In this notation,
the top of the stack is to the right.

The symbols include:

addr    memory address
b       8 bit byte (i.e. hi 8 bits zero)
c       7 bit ASCII character (hi 9 bits zero)
d       32 bit signed double integer, most significant portion with sign
        on top of stack.
f       boolean flag.  0 = false, non-zero = true.
ff      boolean false flag = 0
n       16 bit signed integer number
u       16 bit unsigned integer
tf      boolean true flag = non-zero

The capital letters on the right show definition characteristics:

C       May only be used within a colon definition.  A digit indicates
        number of memory addresses used, if other than one.
E       Intended for execution only.
L0      Level zero definition of FORTH-78
L1      Level 1 definition of FORTH-78
P       Has precedence bit set.  Will execute even when compiling.
U       A user variable.

Unless otherwise noted, all references to numbers are for 16 bit signed integers.
The high byte of a number is on top of the stack, with the sign on the leftmost
bit.  For 32 bit signed double numbers, the most significant bit (with the sign)
is on top.

All arithmetic is implicitly 16 bit signed integer math, with error and underflow
indication specified.

NOTE:   All references to disc in this documentation can be read as references to
the disc simulation area in memory from C200H to F000H, which are treated as a
very limited disk capacity by White Lightning, and do not in any way change the
operation or description of any of the FORTH words defined in this documentation.
DO NOT use DR0, DR1 or GO.


!               n addr ---                                                       L0

Store 16 bits of n at address.  Pronounced "store".


!CSP

Save the stack position in CSP.  Used as part of the compiler security.
