**The Sprite Screen Cursors**

Now that you're used to moving the CHR$ SQR cursor around, moving the sprite
screen cursors is a piece of cake:

1.  Move the X cursor by pressing SYMBOL SHIFT and the 5 or 8 key to move left or
right respectively.

NOTE:  If you've never been able to remember which is the X or which is
       the Y movement, remember this little saying:
       X is a cross - if you say it quickly it sounds like, X is across -
       which it is!

2.  Move the Y cursor by pressing SYMBOL SHIFT and the 7 or 6 key to move up or
down respectively.


**Character Building**

No, not yours - building up characters to mike up sprites!  You've probably got
quite a mess in the CHR$ SQR, so let's clear it:

1.  Press the Q key and respond to the prompt in the text line by pressing Y and
the CHR$ SQR will clear.

Just to get you used to a similar function, let's clear the Sprite Screen as well,
even though it's clear:

1.  As you can see, to clear the CHR$ SQR press Q, to clear the sprite screen
press SYMBOL SHIFT Q - cunning eh?

Now that we have clear screens we can start to go places.  Have a go at this:

1.  Move the X and Y cursors to 1 and 1 respectively.

2.  Press the Z key (to call up a character from the Arcade Library) and enter the
number 63 followed by ENTER.  A space invader type character will appear on the
sprite screen.

3.  Press the K key and answer Y to the prompt and hey presto - the character has
been placed in the CHR$ SQR.

This will illustrate quite nicely how a character is built up.

Have a go at changing this character using the 5, 6, 7 or 8 keys to move the CHR$
SQR cursor and the 9 and 0 keys to set or clear a square.  You won't be able to
see the CHR$ SQR cursor at the moment - just press one of the cursor keys and it
will flash for you.


Let's GET your 'new character' into memory:

1.  Move the sprite screen cursors to X POS 4 and Y POS 4 (SYMBOL SHIFT 5, 6, 7,
and 8)

2.  Press the J key and answer Y to the question.

3.  Your new character was placed on the sprite screen from the CHR$ SQR by using
the J key. Your original character is still there at X POS 1 Y POS 1.
