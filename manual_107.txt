**HLD**                    --- addr                           L0

A user variable that holds the address of the latest character of text during
numeric output conversion.


**HOLD**                 c ---                                L0

Used between <# and #> to insert an ASCII character into a pictured numeric output
string.

e.g.  2E HOLD will place a decimal point.


**I**                      --- n                            C,L0

Used within a DO-LOOP to copy the loop index to the stack.  Other use is
implementation dependent.  See R.


**ID.**               addr ---

Print a definition's name from its name field address.


**IF**                   f ---          (run-time)
                       --- addr n   (compile)        P,C2,L0

Occurs is a colon-definition in the form:
              IF  (tp)  ...  ENDIF
              IF  (tp)  ...  ELSE  (fp)  ...  ENDIF
At run-time, IF selects execution based on a boolean flag.  If f is a true
(non-zero), execution continues ahead through the true part.  If f is false
(zero), execution skips till just after ELSE to execute the false part.  After
either part, execution resumes after ENDIF.  ELSE and its false part are optional;
if missing, false execution skips to just after ENDIF.

At compile time, IF compiles 0BRANCH and reserves space for an offset at addr.
addr and n are used later for resolution of the offset and error testing.


**IMMEDIATE**

Mark the most recently made definition so that when encountered at compile time it
will be executed rather than compiled, i.e.  the precedence bit in its header is
set.  This method allows definitions to handle unusual compiling situations,
rather than build them into the fundamental compiler.  The user may force
compilation of an immediate definition by preceding it with [COMPILE].


**IN**                     --- addr                           L0

A user variable containing the byte offset within the current input text buffer
(terminal or disc) from which the next text will be accepted.  WORD uses and moves
the value of IN.
