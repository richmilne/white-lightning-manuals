SOME SIMPLE PROGRAMMING EXAMPLES

Example 1

To scroll a window at row 8, column 9, 5 characters high by 10 characters long, 1
pixel to the left with wrap - type:

: DEM1 5 HGT ! 10 LEN ! 8 ROW ! 9 COL ! WRL1V ; <CR>

To put some data on the screen: VLIST <CR>

To scroll the window 100 times type:

: DEM2 100 0 DO DEM1 LOOP ; <CR>
DEM2 <CR>

To execute DEM1 in background type: ' DEM1 INT-ON <CR>

To halt the background execution of DEM1 type: INT-OFF <CR>


Example 2

To scroll a window at column 12, row 3, 10 characters high and 5 characters wide,
downward by 3 pixels with wrap - type:

: DEM3 10 HGT ! 5 LEN ! -3 NPX ! 2 ROW ! 12 COL ! WCRV ; <CR>

to define the word, then: DEM3 <CR> to execute it.

To run DEM3 in background type:

' DEM3 INT-ON <CR>

To halt the background execution type: INT-OFF <CR>


Example 3

To invert a window at column 10, row 5, 4 characters high and 4 characters wide -
type:

: DEM4 4 HGT ! 4 LEN ! 5 ROW ! 10 COL ! INVV ; <CR>

and then DEM4 <CR> to execute.


Example 4

It is not always necessary to use colon definitions to achieve a particular
result.  To PUT sprite 34 (If you've got the Demo sprites loaded or have already
defined your own sprite 34) at row 5, column 6, and replace any data currently at
that position - type:

34 SPN ! 5 ROW ! 6 COL ! PUTBLS <CR>
