SOME SIMPLE PROGRAMMING EXAMPLES


Example 1

To scroll a window at row 8, column 9, 5 characters high by 10 characters
long, 1 pixel to the left with wrap:
: DEM1 5 HGT ! 10 LEN ! 8 ROW ! 9 COL ! WRL1V ;

To put some data on the screen:
VLIST

To scroll the window 100 times:
: DEM2 100 0 DO DEM1 LOOP ;
DEM2

To execute DEM1 in background:
' DEM1 INT-ON

To halt the background execution of DEM1:
INT-OFF


Example 2

To scroll a window at column 12, row 3, 10 characters high and 5
characters wide, downward by 3 pixels with wrap:
: DEM3 10 HGT ! 5 LEN ! -3 NPX ! 2 ROW ! 12 COL ! WCRV ;
to define the word, then:
DEM3
to execute it.

To run DEM3 in background:
' DEM3 INT-ON

To halt the background execution:
INT-OFF


Example 3

To invert a window at column 10, row 5, 4 characters high and 4 characters
wide:
: DEM4 4 HGT ! 4 LEN ! 5 ROW ! 10 COL ! INVV ;
and then:
DEM4
to execute.


Example 4

It is not always necessary to use colon definitions to achieve a
particular result. To PUT sprite 34 (if you've got the demo sprites loaded
or have already defined your own sprite 34) at row 5, column 6, and
replace any data currently at that position:
34 SPN ! 5 ROW ! 6 COL ! PUTBLS
