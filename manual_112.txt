addr	U
OUT	alter and p user variable that contains a value inczanented by EMIT. The user may examine CM to control display f0rmatt'ng' OVER	nl n2
-- nl n2 nl
Copy the second stack value, placing it as the new top•	10
PAD	-- addr
Leave the address of the text output buffer' which is a fixed offset above HERE.
PFA	nfa -- Pfa
Convert the name field address of a compiled definition to its parameter field
address.
POP
The code sequence to i,,,we a stack value and return to t~CT• PUP is not directly
executable, but is a Forth re-entry Point after machine code.
PREV	--- a3dr
A variable containing k tlte~address f~ ~edisc rf~it~,t~ disc.
lY reference3.
The UPDATE commend
PUSH	pushes machine registers to the amputation stack and returns
This ~e sequence ~
to	-table, but is a Forth re-entry point after
NEXT. It is not directly
machine code.
PUT
This code sequence stores machine register contents o`~ the topmast computation value and returns to NEXT. It is not directly executable,
but is a Forth re-entry
point after machine code.
QUERY
Input 80 characters of text (or until a"return") from the operator's terminalTe(t is positioned at the address contained in TIE, with I<` set ro zero.
QUIT
Clear the return stack, stop compilation and return control to the operator's
terminal. No	is given. 111
- n	U
. ~r variable which my contain the location of an editing cursor, or other file

lated function.
n~	- addr	U
~~ user variable which may contain the location of an editing cursor, or other file -+lated function.
«iW	addr blk

---',C Fig-Forth standard read-write linkage. addr specifies the source or
l stination block buffer. blk is the sequential number of the referenced block; ,rid f is a flag for f-0 write and f-1 read. R/H determines the location on mass

,corage, performs the read-write and any error checking.
tu	-- n	LO
i<Fmove the top value from the return stack and leave it on the amputation stack. ~~ee >R and R.
n0	-- addr	U

A user variable containing the initial location of the return stack. Pronounced 1, zero. See IT!
REPEAT	addr n -- (compiling)	P,C2
ii.~xi within a colon-definition in the form:
BEGIN ... MILE ... REPEAT
;+t_ run-time , REPEAT forces an unconditional branch back to just after the ~.~rresponding EEGG1N.
A'- compile time, REPEAT compiles HWCH and the offset from HERE to addr. n is -ed for error testing.
ROT	nl n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1	IA
Rotate the top three values m the stack, bringing the third to the top. RPO	addr
i-~ves the current value in the return stack pointer register. RP!

n-omputer dependent procedure to initialise the return stack pointer from user variable R0.
S >D	n -- d
