R                      --- n                                                       

Copy the top of the return stack to the computation stack. 


R#                     --- addr                                                   U

A user variable which may contain the location of an editing cursor, or other file related function. 


R/W         addr blk f ---                                                         

The fig-FORTH standard disc read-write linkage.  addr specifies the source or destination block buffer, blk is the sequential number of the referenced block; and f is a flag for f=O write and f=l read.  R/W determines the location on mass storage, performs the read-write and performs any error checking. 


R>                     --- n                                                     L0

Remove the top value from the return stack and leave it on the computation stack.  See >R and R. 


R0                     --- addr                                                   U

A user variable containing the initial location of the return stack.  Pronounced R-zero.  See RP!


REPEAT          addr n --- (compiling)                                         P,C2

Used within a colon-definition in the form:
                  BEGIN ...  WHILE ...  REPEAT
At run-time, REPEAT forces an unconditional branch back to just after the corresponding BEGIN. 
 
At compile-time, REPEAT compiles BRANCH and the offset from HERE to addr.  n is used for error testing. 


ROT           nl n2 n3 --- n2 n3 nl                                              L0

Rotate the top three values on the stack, bringing the third to the top.

A computer dependent procedure to initialize the return stack pointer from user variable R0. 


S->D                 n --- d                                                       

Sign extend a single number to form a double number.
