R                      --- n

Copy the top of the return stack to the computation stack.


R#                     --- addr                            U

A user variable which may contain the location of an editing cursor, or other file
related function.


R/W         addr blk f ---

The Fig-FORTH standard read-write linkage.  addr specifies the source or
destination block buffer.  blk is the sequential number of the referenced block;
and f is a flag for f=0 write and f=1 read.  R/W determines the location on mass
storage, performs the read-write and any error checking.


R>                     --- n                              L0

Remove the top value from the return stack and leave it on the computation stack.
See >R and R.


R0                     --- addr                            U

A user variable containing the initial location of the return stack.  Pronounced
R-zero.  See RP!


REPEAT          addr n --- (compiling)                  P,C2

Used within a colon-definition in the form:
                BEGIN  ...  WHILE  ...  REPEAT
At run-time, REPEAT forces an unconditional branch back to just after the
corresponding BEGIN.

At compile-time, REPEAT compiles BRANCH and the offset from HERE to addr.  n is
used for error testing.


ROT           nl n2 n3 --- n2 n3 nl                       L0

Rotate the top three values on the stack, bringing the third to the top.


RP@               addr

Leaves the current value in the return stack pointer register.


RP!

A computer dependent procedure to initialise the return stack pointer from user
variable R0.


S->D                 n --- d

Sign extend a single number to form a double number.
