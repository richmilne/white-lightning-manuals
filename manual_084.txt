G        Activates GET SPRITE function.
         Gets a sprite of the dimensions held in the "Sprite height" and
         "Sprite length" variables, using the number held in the "Sprite
         Number" variable and at the window indicated by the sprite screen
         cursor - and stores it in memory.

         NOTE:  If the Attribute switch = 1, the sprite and attributes
         are stored; if the Attribute switch = 0, then any Attributes will
         be ignored. When a sprite is first defined with Attribute
         switch = 0 the attribute data will probably be garbage.

H        Activates the SPRITE HEIGHT Variable.
         Permits the input of the height of a sprite window from 1-15.

I        Activates the ATTRIBUTE DUMP function.
         Places the four Attributes set in the four Attribute Variables,
         to the sprite screen, at the position indicated by the sprite
         screen cursors - with a resolution of one character.

         NOTE:  This function is independent of the Attribute Switch, e.g.
         to place Attributes at position x=4, y=4:  position sprite screen
         cursors at x=4 and y=4, then set the four attributes as required
         (you can then set the Attribute switch to 0 (OFF) if you like)
         and press I.

J        Activates the move CHR$ SQR TO SPRITE SCREEN function.
         Dumps the bit pattern set in the CHR$ SQR to a character square
         in the sprite screen, indicated by the sprite screen cursors.

         NOTE:  If the Attribute Switch = 0, no Attributes will move with
         the pattern.  If the Attribute switch = 1, then the Attributes
         held in the Attribute Variables will move with the pattern.

K        Activates the MOVE SPRITE SCREEN CHARACTER TO CHR$ SQR
         function.
         Picks up the Character Square indicated by the Sprite Screen
         Cursors, into the CHR$ SQR.

         NOTE:  ATTR = 0 ignores Character Attributes.  ATTR = 1 takes the
         Attributes of the character and loads them into the Attribute
         Variables.

L        Activates the SPRITE LENGTH variable.
         Permits the input of the length of a Sprite Window from 1-15.

M        Activates the Sprite Functions.
         You will be given three options which act in the same way as the
         'SCREEN FUNCTIONS E', except that these functions operate on
         the sprite in memory only and have no effect directly on the
         screen.

N        Activates the No, negative response to (Y/N) questions.

O        Activates the Sprite Logic functions.
         You will he given three options.  Each option GETS an area of the
         sprite screen, the dimensions of which are specified as those of
         the defined sprite, having a top left-hand corner at the sprite screen
         cursor positions and logically GETs the data into the defined sprite -
         - whose number is in the Sprite Number Variable.
