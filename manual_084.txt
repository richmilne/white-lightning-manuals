G    Get Sprite function
    Gets the current sprite and stores it in memory.


Activates GET SPRITE function.    .-    •.. ..    .     _    .. Gets a sprite of the dimensions held in 
the "Sprite height" and "Sprite length" variables, wing the number held in the 'Sprite Number: 
variable and at the window indicated by the sprite screen cursor - and stores it in memory.

NYIti: If the Attribute witch = 1, the sprite and attributes are stored; if the Attribute witch 
= 0, then any Attributes will be Ignored. When a sprite is first defined with Attribute switch = 
0[he attribute data will probably be garbage.

H    Sprite Height variable
    Input the height of sprite window: 1-15.

Activates the SPRITE HEIGHT Variable.
Permits the input of the height of a sprite window from 1-15.

I    Attribute Dump function
    Places the current attributes to the current Sprite Screen
    position.

Activates the a7lStieUtE BLIMP function.
Places the four Attributes set in the four Attribute Variables, to the sprite screw, at the 
position indicated by the sprite screen cursors - with a resolution of one character.

W1ti: This function is independent of the Attribute Switch, e.g. to place Attributes at position 
z=4, y=4: position sprite screen cursors at r4 and y--4, then set the four attributes as 
required (you can then set the Attribute switch to 0 (OFF) if you like) and press I.

J    Move CHR$ SQR to Sprite Screen function
    Dumps the CHR$ SQR bit pattern to the current Sprite Screen
    position.

Activates the move (HIIiS SCji TO SPRITE SCFtEtN function.
Dumps the bit pattern set in the CF)si$ Sqt to a character square in the sprite screen, 
indicated by the sprite screen cursors.

Nt71E: If the Attribute Switch = 0, no Attributes will move with the pattern. If the Attribute 
switch = 1, then the Attributes held in the Attribute Variables will Nam with the pattern.

K    Move Sprite Screen to CHR$ SQR function
    Dumps the bit pattern from the character square at the current
    Sprite Screen position to the CHR$ SQR.

Activates the MOVE SPRITE SCREEN CHARACTER TO CFi{RS SCJt function.
Picks up the Character Square indicated by the Sprite Screw Cursors, into the CHRS 90t.

6D'lti: AM = 0 ignores Character Attributes. ATLR = 1 takes the Attributes of the character and 
loads then into the Attribute Variables.

L    Sprite Length variable
    Input the length of sprite window: 1-15.

Activates the SPRITE I--VH variable.
Permits the input of the length of a Sprite Window from 1-15.

M    Sprite functions
    There are three options: 1 = Invert; 2 = Mirror; 3 = Mirror Attributes
    These act on the sprite in memory, rather than on the screen (E).

Activates the Sprite Functions.
You will be given three options which act In the same way as the 'SCREEN FUPCTIONS E', except 
that these functions operate on the sprite in mamory only and have no effect directly m the 
screen.

N    No - negative response to questions

Activates the No, negative response to (Y/N) questions.

O    Sprite Logic functions
    There are three options, each of which GETs an area of the Sprite
    Screen from the current Sprite Screen position of the size of the
    current sprite and GETs the data into the current sprite:
    1 = GETORS;  ORs the screen data with the pre-defined sprite
    2 = GETXRS; XORs the screen data with the pre-defined sprite
    3 = GETNDS; ANDs the screen data with the pre-defined sprite

Activates the Sprite logic functions.
You will he given three options. Each option GETS an area of the sprite screen, the dimensions 
of which are specified as those of
the defined sprite, having a top left-hand corner at the sprite screen cursor positions and 
logically GETS the data into the defined sprite - - whose number is in the Sprite Number 
Variable.
