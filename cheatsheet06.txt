TSPN     Temporary Value for SPN
TCOL     Temporary Value for COL
TROW     Temporary Value for ROW
XC       X co-ordinate
YC       Y co-ordinate
FLAG     Collision Flag

We'll also use a constant FSPN which holds the number of the first sprite in the
series of 16.  To adapt these routines for your own use just change FSPN.

: PLOAD COL ! ROW ! SPN ! PUTXRS ;
: PSET TSPN @ TROW @ TCOL @ ;
: PCAL 4 /MOD TCOL ! SWAP 4 /MOD TROW ! DUP + DUP + FSPN + + TSPN ! ;
: MOVE YC @ XC @ PCAL PSET PUTXRS PLOAD ;
: PLACE YC @ XC @ PCAL PSET PLOAD ;

We now need to poll the keyboard:

We use the KCHK word again an that the character is not re-PUT unless a key has
been pressed.

: KCHK KB DUP ROT OR SWAP ;
: UP 7 1 KCHK IF YC @ 4 > MINUS YC +! ENDIF ;
: DOWN 8 1 KCHK IF YC @ 83 < YC +! ENDIF ;
: LEFT 1 1 KCHK IF XC @ 4 > MINUS XC +! ENDIF ;
: RIGHT 1 2 KCHK IF XC @ 115 < XC +! ENDIF ;
: KREAD 0 UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT ;

KREAD will leave 0 on the stack if no key was pressed or 1 if a key was pressed.

The complete word becomes:

: TESTF 10 XC ! 10 YC ! PLACE BEGIN KREAD IF MOVE ENDIF 6 1 KB UNTIL ;

Note that this loop assumes no interference with the values of COL, ROW or SPN
between cycles, if you are executinq another Forth word, for example a word called
TRY, then make sure you temporarily stack COL, ROW and SPN, e.g.

... BEGIN KREAD IF MOVE ENDIF COL @ ROW @ SPN @ TRY SPN ! ROW ! COL ! 0 1 KB UNTIL
...

This word can be easily executed under interrupt using

: TESTG KREAD IF MOVE ENDIF ;
: TESTH 10 XC ! 10 YC ! EXX PLACE EXX ' TESTG INT-ON BEGIN 6 1 KB UNTIL INT-OFF
;

You will notice, however, that if you do execute this routine under interrupt then
the sprite may flicker in passage through certain areas of the screen.  This is
due to the finite time taken for the dot to scan the screen and can be very annoying.

To execute from source type 11 LOAD 12 LOAD then TESTF or TESTH

Let's look now at some more powerful techniques which not only help with the
flickering but also include collision detection facilities.
