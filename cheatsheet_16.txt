THRUST

If the lander still has fuel and hasn't reached terminal upward velocity then
increase upward velocity.

MV

A fairly complicated word which moves the lander vertically.  The velocity is
added to the position (physicists note that unit time has elapsed etc).  If the
lander goes under the base its position is put equal to the base and DOWN is SET
to 1.  The row and orientation are then calculated.

BANG

Another fairly involved word which executes a crash if DOWN=1.  It checks to see
if a safe landing was made and if not decides what sort of crash is required.

OK

A short word which sets DOWN to 0, indicating a safe landing.

LAND

If the lander has zero sideways velocity then vertical velocity and horizontal
position are checked for a safe landing or a crash.  DOWN is set accordingly.

XG

Updates X-VEL PHASE and sets window for scroll.

RSET1

Sets COL and LEN back after XG.

XVEL

Controlling routine for XVEL gauge.

YG

Used to adjust Y-VEL gauge.

WUP

Move up Y-VEL gauge.

WDOWN

Move down Y-VEL gauge.

YVEL

Controlling routine for Y-VEL gauge.

FVEL

Controlling routine for fuel gauge.

MXG

Used to set up window for small screen movement.
