BASIC INTERFACE WORDS

These words are provided to enable you to mix BASIC and Forth in your program. 
The section covering the access of BASIC should be read carefully before an 
attempt is made to use these commands.


Command                Action

PROG         Enter BASIC at command level.

RESERVE      Reserve space in the dictionary for the insertion of BASIC 
             source.  The size of the space to be reserved is taken from
             the stack.

Example:

1024 RESERVE

will reserve 1k from the current value of HERE.

GOTO         The BASIC program is executed from the line number held
             on the stack.  Forth can be called from BASIC using 
             RANDOMISE USR 30000 and Forth can be re-entered using 
             PRINT USR 30006.

Example:

100 GOTO

will commence execution of the BASIC source from line 100.

RETUSR       Control is returned to the BASIC program from Forth. 
             Execution of the BASIC program proceeds with the first 
             instruction after the RANDOMISE USR 30000 with which Forth
             was called.  Do not execute a RETUSR in Forth if Forth has
             not been called using a RANDOMISE USR 30000 call.


MISCELLANEOUS WORDS

There are 18 words provided which cover general aspects of games development.


Command                 Action

SETAV        Set the attributes to the current INK and PAPER oolours in
             the screen window defined by HGT, LEN, COL, ROW.

SETAM        Set the attributes to the current INK and PAPER colours in
             the sprite whose number is held in SPN.

CLSV         Clear the screen window (defined by HGT, LEN, COL, ROW)
             of pixel data and set the attributes throughout to the
             current INK and PAPER colours.

CLSM         Clear the pixel data of the sprite whose number is held
             in SPN.  Attribute data is unaffected.
