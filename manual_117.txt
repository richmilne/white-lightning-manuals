WORD                 c ---                                L0

Read the next text characters from the input stream being interpreted, until a
delimiter c is found, storing the packed character string beginning at the
dictionary buffer HERE. WORD leaves the character count in the first byte, the
characters, and ends with two or more blanks.  Leading occurrences of c are
ignored.  If BLK is zero, text is taken from the terminal input buffer, otherwise
from the disc block stored in BLK.  See BLK, IN.


X

This is pseudonym for the "null" or dictionary entry for a name of one character
of ASCII null.  It is the execution procedure to terminate interpretation of a
line of text from the terminal or within a disc buffer, as both buffers always
have a null at the end.


XOR              n1 n2 --- xor                            L1

Leave the bit-wise logical Exclusive-OR of two values.


[                                                       P,L1

Used in a colon-definition in the form:
                  : xxx   words   more   ;
Suspend  compilation.  The words after [ are executed, not compiled.  This allows
calculation or compilation exceptions before resuming compilation with ].  See
LITERAL, ].


[COMPILE]                                                P,C

Used in a colon-definition in the form:
                  : xxx [COMPILE] FORTH  ;
[COMPILE] will force the compilation of an immediate definitions, that would
otherwise execute during compilation. The above example will select the FORTH
vocabulary when xxx executes, rather than at compile time.


]                                                         L1

Resume compilation, to the completion of a colon-definition.  See [.
