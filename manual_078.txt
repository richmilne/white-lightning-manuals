0 VARIABLE CONTROL CONTROL U. <CR>

This will set up a variable called CONTROL, set it to zero and then print the 
address of the least significant byte which we'll use to pass the information. 
For the sake of this example suppose the address was 50000.  We'll now use the 
CASE construct to select the word to execute.  Use the following definitions:

: SELECT CASE 1 OF ." WORD1 " ENDOF 2 OF ." WORD2 " <CR>
ENDOF 3 OF ." WORD3 " ENDOF 4 OF ." WORD4 " ENDOF <CR>
ENDCASE CR ; <CR>

If the value in CONTROL is 1 to 4, the appropriate word will be executed.

: RUN 4000 GOTO BEGIN CONTROL @ <CR>
DUP SELECT DUP IF RETUSR ENDIF 0= UNTIL ; <CR>

The BASIC program is initially entered at 4000 and could take the following form:

4000 REM REPLACE ADDRESS 5000 WITH THE ADDRESS OF CONTROL
4010 PRINT " EXECUTE WORD1 " : GOSUB 5000
4020 PRINT " EXECUTE WORD2 " : GOSUB 5010
4030 PRINT " EXECUTE WORD3 " : GOSUB 5020
4040 PRINT " EXECUTE WORD4 " : GOSUB 5030 
4050 PRINT " FINISH " : POKE 50000,0 : PRINT USR 30006
5000 POKE 5000,1 : RANDOMISE USR 30000 : RETURN
5010 POKE 5000,2 : RANDOMISE USR 30000 : RETURN
5020 POKE 5000,3 : RANDOMISE USR 30000 : RETURN 
5030 POKE 5000,4 : RANDOMISE USR 30000 : RETURN

Note that when final return is made to Forth a PRINT USR 30006 is used.  If a 
RANDOMISE USR 30006 CALL is made to Forth a RETUSR must be executed or the BASIC 
stack will be left corrupted.  To reset the stack if it has been corrupted, use 
PROG to enter BASIC and then re-enter Forth with the WARM start, PRINT USR 24836.

This concludes the section on the BASIC Interface.
