0 VARIABLE CONTROL CONTROL U. <CR>

This will set up a variable called CONTROL, set it to zero and then print
the address of the least significant byte, which we'll use to pass the
information. For the sake of this example suppose the address was 50000.
We'll now use the CASE construct to select the word to execute. Use the
following definition:
: SELECT CASE 1 OF ." WORD1 " ENDOF 2 OF ." WORD2 " <CR>
ENDOF 2 OF ." WORD3 " ENDOF 4 OF ." WORD4 " ENDOF <CR>
ENDCASE CR ; <CR>

If the value in CONTROL is 1 to 4, the appropriate word will be executed.

: RUN 4000 GOTO BEGIN CONTROL @ <CR>
DUP SELECT DUP IF RETUSR ENDIF 0= UNTIL ; <CR>

The BASIC program is initially entered at 4000 and could take the
following form:

4000 REM REPLACE ADDRESS 50000 WITH THE ADDRESS OF CONTROL
4010 PRINT " EXECUTE WORD1 ": GOSUB 5000
4020 PRINT " EXECUTE WORD2 ": GOSUB 5010
4030 PRINT " EXECUTE WORD3 ": GOSUB 5020
4040 PRINT " EXECUTE WORD4 ": GOSUB 5030
4050 PRINT " FINISH ": POKE 50000,0: PRINT USR 30006
5000 POKE 50000,1: RANDOMIZE USR 30000: RETURN
5010 POKE 50000,2: RANDOMIZE USR 30000: RETURN
5020 POKE 50000,3: RANDOMIZE USR 30000: RETURN
5030 POKE 50000,4: RANDOMIZE USR 30000: RETURN

Note that when the final return is made to Forth a PRINT USR 30006 is
used. If a RANDOMIZE USR 30006 call is made to Forth a RETUSR must be
executed of the BASIC stack will be left corrupted. To reset the stack if
it has been corrupted, use PROG to enter BASIC and then re-enter Forth
with the WARM start, PRINT USR 24836.

This concludes the section on the BASIC Interface.
