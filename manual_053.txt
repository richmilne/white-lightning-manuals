WRL4V WRL4V WRL4V

and you should see it!

Parameters do not reset after the execution of the commands,  so to repeat the
above, this time at column 10 and without wrap, you could use the following:

10 COL ! SCL4V <CR>


Vertical scrolls

These work in a similar way to the horizontal scrolls, but in addition to setting
up the window with the four window parameters COL, ROW, HGT and LEN, a further
variable NPX is used to give the size and direction of the scroll in pixels. A
positive value for NPX causes upward scrolling and a negative value causes
downward scrolling.


Parameter               Use

COL          Column at left hand edge of window (0-31)
ROW          Row of top left edge of the window (0-23)
LEN          Width of the window (1-32)
HGT          Height of the window (1-24)

Command               Action

WCRV         Vertical scroll with wrap
SCRV         Vertical scroll, no wrap

Note:

All vertical scrolling of pixel data and/or attributes for screen or sprites,
requires buffer space.  The space required is calculated by multiplying NPX by
LEN.  The start of the buffer is taken as the next free byte after sprite space,
so be sure that either a COLD# has been executed, or that SPND has been set.  It
is safe practice to develop sprites using the software provided, and to allow 256
bytes buffer at the top before linking with the main program.  Be sure also that
the scroll length is not greater than the window's size.  On entry to White
Lightning a COLD# is automatiacally executed and a scrolling buffer of 256 bytes
is set up.  This is maintained so long as ISPRITE and DSPRITE are used in
preference to SPRITE and WIPE.


Attribute Scrolls

Attribute scrolls are similar to the pixel data scrolls but all scrolls are always
by one character, with wrap.


Parameter                  Use

COL        Column of the left hand edge of the window (0-31)
ROW        Row of the top edge of the window (0-23)
LEN        Width of the window (1-32)
HGT        Height of the window (1-24)
