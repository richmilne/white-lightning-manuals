KB           This command is provided for the detection of multiple key
             presses.  All it does, in fact, is test the specified key
             and stack a true flag if the key is pressed and a false flag if
             it is not.  The key to he tested is specified by the top two
             numbers on the stack.  The second value specifies the half ROW
             and the top value the COLUMN.  For a full description 
             of the COLUMNS and ROWS of the Spectrum keyboard see page 160
             of the Spectrum manual.  Below is a summary.

                  ROW               KEYS

                   1               CAPS SHIFT to V
                   2               A to G
                   3               Q to T
                   4               1 to 5
                   5               0 to 6
                   6               P to 7
                   7               ENTER to H
                   8               SPACE to B


Columns are organised from 1 to 5 and counted from the outside in.  This is the 
order above.


BLEEP        This operates in the same way as the Spectrum's BEEP
             command with the second number on the stack providing
             duration and top number pitch.
Example:

100 200 BLEEP


ATTON        After the execution of ATTON, group 1 GETs and PUTs will GET
             and PUT attribute data at the same time as they GET and PUT
             pixel data.  The GW and PW commands, however, are unaffected
             by ATTON or ATTOFF and always use separate commands to
             move pixel data.  After the execution of a GW or PW command
             the attribute switch is always set to 'OFF'.
