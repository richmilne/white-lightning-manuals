BEGIN                  --- addr n (compiling)                                  P,L0

Occurs in a colon-definition in form:
   BEGIN ...  UNTIL

   BEGIN ...  AGAIN

   BEGIN ...  WHILE ...  REPEAT
At run-time, BEGIN marks the start of a sequence that may be repetitively executed.  It serves as a return point from the corresponding UNTIL, AGAIN or REPEAT.  When executing UNTIL, a return to BEGIN will occur if the top of the stack is false; for AGAIN and REPEAT a return to BEGIN always occurs. 
 
At compile time BEGIN leaves its return address and n for compiler error checking. 


BL                     --- c                                                       

A constant that leaves the ascii value for "blank". 


BLANKS      addr count ---                                                         

Fill an area of memory beginning at addr with blanks. 


BLK                    --- addr                                                U,L0

A user variable containing the block number being interpreted.  If zero, input is being taken from the terminal input buffer. 


BLOCK                n --- addr                                                  L0

Leave the memory address of the block buffer containing block n.  If the block is not already in memory, it is transferred from disc to which ever buffer Was least recently written.  If the block occupying that buffer has been marked as updated, it is rewritten to disc before block n is read into the buffer.  See also BUFFER, R/W UPDATE FLUSH


BLOCK-READ                                                                         
BLOCK-WRITE                                                                        

These are the preferred names for the installation dependent code to read and write one block to the disc. 


BRANCH                                                                        C2,L0

The run-time proceedure to unconditionally branch.  An in-line offset is added to the interpretive pointer IP to branch ahead or back.  BRANCH is compiled by ELSE, AGAIN, REPEAT. 


BUFFER               n --- addr                                                    

Obtain the next memory buffer, assigning it to block n.  If the contents of the buffer is marked as updated, it is written to the disc The block is not read from the disc.  The address left is the first cell within the buffer for data storage. 


C!              b addr ---                                                         

Store 8 bits at address.  On word addressing computers, further specification is necessary regarding byte addressing.
