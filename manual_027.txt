and execution of SQUARE ends at the semi-colon.

If we now wished, we could define a new word using our word SQUARE.

We are now going to discuss control structures.  It must be remembered, that the 
control structures can only be incorporated in colon definitions, or an error will
result.


6. CONTROL STRUCTURES

LOOPS

There are essentially two forms of loop operation:

 (i)  DO...  LOOP

(ii)  DO... +LOOP

The first loop structure is used as follows:

limit start DO ... 'Forth words' ... LOOP

The Forth words within the loop are executed until start = limit, increnenting the
start (or index) by one each time. Type:

: TEST1 5 0 DO ." Forth " CR LOOP ; <CR>
Typing in TEST1 <CR>
will print Forth
           Forth
           Forth
           Forth
           Forth

The second loop structure is used as follows:

limit start DO ...'Forth words' increment +LOOP

The Forth words within the loop are executed fran start to limit, with the index 
being incremented or decremented by the value increment. Try:

: TEST2 5 0 CO ." HELLO " 2 +LOOP ; <CR>
Executing TEST2 will print HELLO HELLO HELLO

Since the limit and the index are held on the return stack, it would be useful if 
we could examine the index.  Well, there are words to do this:
